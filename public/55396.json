No reason not to.<br /><br />(L) I reckon!<br /><br />A: We are here, do not fear. Milonnioa of Cassiopaea.<br /><br />Q: (L) Whatever. All right. So I guess the big question on everybody&#039;s mind as NiallyBob just put it a minute ago, &quot;How about those drones?!&quot; I think we better break it down into a little bit better questions than that. Are the drones a strictly human-originated phenomenon?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (L) Are some of the drones, say, hyperdimensional for lack of a... hyperdimensional, alien, or whatever?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) Is there a visible difference between the human origin drones and the hyperdimensional drones?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) Why are they appearing in such great numbers and over such a wide area and apparently for a long time period? Yeah, so I&#039;m asking why?<br /><br />A: Many reasons depending on which time, place, and context. Closest description is human origin drones are meant to distract from &quot;alien&quot; drones and probes.<br /><br />Q: (L) What are the alien drones or probes up to?<br /><br />A: Psychic reading and influencing of selected populations.<br /><br />Q: (L) Is there any significance to the fact that this has happened kind of repeatedly over a period of at least five years at approximately the same time of the year?<br /><br />(Andromeda) Well, from what I understand, the last three years have been at the same time of year.<br /><br />(L) Last three years.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Right. And then before that there was one in July or something.<br /><br />(Joe) Here&#039;s the thing: A year ago, almost a year ago, and the year before, there were drones sighted over Langley Air Force Base. Last year for 17 days.<br /><br />(Chu) There was one in December-January, 2019 according to Approaching Infinity.<br /><br />(Joe) Yeah, I mean, you can go back quite a long time for sightings over military bases. You can go back to the sixties if you want. So the question is whether or not the sightings, for example one year ago over Langley Air Force Base, have anything to do with what&#039;s happening today? Or is that a separate...?<br /><br />(L) So are they all related in some way?<br /><br />A: Similar.<br /><br />Q: (L) So they&#039;re there for reading and influencing of selected populations?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Over a military base.<br /><br />(Niall) Specifically military populations?<br /><br />(Joe) Only a military base.<br /><br />(L) Is it specifically military or, okay... Is it only military?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) They were also spotted over two US military bases in the UK, and one in Germany, both this year in November.<br /><br />(Chu) And if you count the orbs, then it&#039;s more widespread.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Well, were those the same kind of thing in the UK and in Germany?<br /><br />A: Close<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So maybe a question is: Given that drones have been sighted over various military bases - and drones as in UFOs, they may be drones, maybe UFOs - over military bases going back many years up until last year. What is the significance of such a widespread phenomenon over the past month?<br /><br />A: Acclimatising the public.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) That&#039;s what I thought. So that was the specific agenda in it being such a widespread phenomenon.<br /><br />(L) Okay, do they also... I mean, I understand that probably a lot of them are... Maybe the reason they&#039;re so plentiful at this point in time is because gradually human beings have built up their stockpile of such drones so they can send them up to confuse things even better than they could before. Is that part of it?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So this would be acclimatizing the public to an eventual disclosure of &quot;aliens&quot;?<br /><br />A: Eventually. But spooking the population is also seen as desirable.<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) They&#039;re trying to spook people.<br /><br />(PoB) It just about spooking or there are other influencing causes or reasons?<br /><br />(L) I think that the human-created drones are seen as being useful for spooking because they put &#039;em up there, they know what they are, they&#039;re in control of &#039;em, but they deny it. And of course that&#039;s like doing the whole COVID thing. People could see stuff in front of their eyes, and it was just being denied. What do they call it?<br /><br />(Andromeda) It&#039;s gaslighting.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, gaslighting.<br /><br />(Joe) So is it true to say that this was like a &quot;aliens&quot; plan to have these drones or craft fly around and then the military, the government, deep state, whatever, decided to put theirs up when they realized it was happening to muddy the waters? Is that a reasonable...?<br /><br />A: Close<br /><br />Q: (Joe) And with all the denials from the government saying there&#039;s nothing going on here, do they actually know fully what is going on?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) They know at least partially that it&#039;s...<br /><br />(L) They know what they&#039;re doing and they know that the aliens are doing something, but they don&#039;t really fully know what the aliens are doing.<br /><br />(Andromeda) What their plan is...<br /><br />(Joe) No, but the question is...<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) Have they tried to shoot one down?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) So people like the Pentagon spoke, at that level of government, ya know, overt government figures... Did they know of this alien presence?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Gaby) So why are the aliens doing it now?<br /><br />A: Part of ongoing plans falling into place. [ferocious dogs growl and bark during answer :)]<br /><br />Q: (L) And I guess we&#039;ve already been told what those plans are.<br /><br />(Joe) Well, are they? Do we? Have we?<br /><br />(L) We have been a number of times.<br /><br />(Joe) Long term or short term?<br /><br />(L) So, you say that they want to influence and read...<br /><br />(Andromeda) And that&#039;s part of a larger plan.<br /><br />(L) Influence and read...<br /><br />(seek10) Can we ask why New Jersey is the spot?<br /><br />A: Heavily programmed population there.<br /><br />Q: (L) Where is that place where they had all those weird experiments going on? Montauk! Where is Montauk in relation to New Jersey?<br /><br />(Joe) Isn&#039;t that New York?<br /><br />(Niall) Long Island, no?<br /><br />[Montauk is a hamlet located at the eastern tip of Long Island, New York]<br /><br />(L) Does Montauk have anything to do with any of this?<br /><br />A: Yes. It is all interrelated.<br /><br />Q: (L) So my guess is that they have people there that are programmed to do things and that they&#039;re interested in determining if they&#039;re ready to perform their programmed activities or if they need additional programming... Okay... Are they planning to turn people on or off in terms of programming?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Surely reading and influencing of members of the population could be done without such a visible display of lights in the sky and stuff. So it seems that the main agenda here is obviously to spook the population and prepare them, like I said, acclimatize them to lights in the sky, UFOs...<br /><br />A: Also, the invisibility granted by a firmly structured density veil is not as secure as previously.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Okay. So it&#039;s likely that a lot more of these things are going to be seen around the world.<br /><br />(L) So does that mean that when people have in the past or in other times and places been read and influenced and so forth - we kind of joke about it as being like the cryptogeographic being - that what&#039;s actually happening is some kind of orbs or something are nearby, only they are concealed from view because the veil is more secure. Is that it?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) So with the veil being less secure, or &quot;thinning&quot; as we call it, that means that a lot more of this type of activity is visually seen and probably will be seen elsewhere - as well as other things that ordinarily would be concealed by the veil. Is that true?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So this is setting up an explanation in advance for that phenomenon being more visible, that people will say, &quot;Oh, it&#039;s just like in New Jersey: It was drones.&quot; It&#039;s a pretty poor effort on the part of government to convince people these are just drones. I mean, I suppose it&#039;s the best they can do, but...<br /><br />(Chu) Well, they&#039;re also telling people, even if they do say they&#039;re aliens, they&#039;re saying, &quot;They&#039;re benevolent! See, they&#039;re not doing anything to you!&quot;<br /><br />(L) Yeah. And the other thing is they&#039;re also trying to really reinforce the idea that it is a totally physical phenomenon. Because I mean, really covering up the highly strange nature of these things is one of their main goals and tricks.<br /><br />(Joe) But surely the &quot;aliens&quot; have the ability to always make it appear as if it&#039;s a physical phenomenon?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (Joe) They don&#039;t always have the ability to appear as drones or lights in the sky?<br /><br />(L) Actually, if you think about it, all the UFO sightings that have been proven to be, or shown to be really legit have always had high strangeness associated with them.<br /><br />(Joe) But not the ones in New Jersey recently.<br /><br />(L) But we&#039;re talking about human-made drones.<br /><br />(Joe) I&#039;m talking about alien drones that are appearing as - generally speaking - as a drone, a drone type object. People are saying that doesn&#039;t look like a plane. It&#039;s too small, it&#039;s weird, et cetera, et cetera. So they&#039;re not able to make it look exactly like a drone. But they do seem to be able to manifest as something that people see as a physical object, albeit a bit strange looking.<br /><br />A: Some of those are human made decoys.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Right.<br /><br />(Chu) And then there&#039;s the weird orbs and stuff that don&#039;t look very human.<br /><br />(Joe) Well, there are a few, but the vast majority are ambiguous.<br /><br />(Andromeda) There&#039;s a mixed bag.<br /><br />(Niall) There&#039;s been a lot of videos of lights flashing on and off.<br /><br />(L) So somebody on the chat wants to know if the UFOs want to gauge how aware the population is getting? Um, do they want to...?<br /><br />A: Testing of the will, yes.<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) And also probably testing for the reaction to that kind of thing.<br /><br />(L) So what were you saying, Niall?<br /><br />(Niall) There are lots of videos people are posting. We don&#039;t know, but they claim to be associated with drones or in the areas where these drones are seen, where either street lights or car lights or building lights are not just flashing, they&#039;re blinking on and off.<br /><br />(Joe) And radio interference.<br /><br />(Niall) Is this associated with the sightings in the sky at all?<br /><br />(L) Your question is really loose. Is this associated with the drones? Or is it associated with the alien craft? I mean, make a distinction here. There&#039;s all kinds of shit going on in the sky.<br /><br />(Niall) I don&#039;t assume that it&#039;s associated with any of it. I don&#039;t know if it is. That&#039;s why I wanna go one first, then the next.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Could it be associated with the human decoy drones, the alien craft, or even part of this thinning of the veil? Weather phenomenon?<br /><br />(L) Yeah.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Is it associated with any of those?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) Which one?<br /><br />A: All sometimes.<br /><br />Q: (L) But we know from case histories that UFOs make cars stop, make things blink, etc. I mean, we&#039;ve seen that repeatedly in the case histories. We also know that overflying comet or meteorite fragments can cause all the car alarms in a neighborhood to go off, as well as all of the garage doors to open and close and so forth because there&#039;s electromagnetic anomalies. And we also know it can happen from weather. So, you&#039;d have to take a particular case in order to get an answer, a particular case and say, was this one due to whatever. Because if it&#039;s happening and the drones are there at the time, we may assume that it&#039;s associated.<br /><br />(Niall) Okay. Well, then let&#039;s assume, okay.<br /><br />(Joe) They said that it was part of an ongoing plan falling into place. Is that a long-term plan, or does this happening now in recent weeks have anything to do with... Is it related in any way to Trump becoming president and something that&#039;s planned for that? Or is it a longer term acclimatization only?<br /><br />A: As previously noted, there was a change in plans, thus some recalibration is needed.<br /><br />Q: (L) So... Okay, let me ask this: Is this activity beneficial to human beings?<br /><br />A: Decidedly not.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Why not?<br /><br />A: Review plans to amalgamate and rule humans after the changes.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) But that was going to happen... Okay, so it&#039;s just part of that longer term plan then.<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) And that was always going to happen, correct?<br /><br />(L) That&#039;s always been their plan, but...<br /><br />(Andromeda) Barring something that changed it, I suppose.<br /><br />(Joe) The C&#039;s have talked about that from day one.<br /><br />(Gaby) Does the current thinning of the veil that&#039;s going on now have anything to do with the 19-year lunar cycle in some sense?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (L) Can the 19-year lunar cycle be associated with a thinning of the veil?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) But not necessarily always. Can the 19-year lunar cycle be utilized in some way to open portals into our reality and that sort of thing?<br /><br />A: Yes indeed!<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) So what is the current thinning of the veil due to?<br /><br />A: Wave.<br /><br />Q: (Gaby) Well, I have a question about the lunar cycle. Is the next major lunar standstill on March 22, 2025 when we could potentially channel some positive energies through gravitational forces?<br /><br />A: Yes!<br /><br />Q: (L) So we should make a plan for the lunar standstill in March. Keep that in mind, everybody! Okay. Are we done with the drones?<br /><br />Q: (Chu) You want to see if any of the questions on the chat catch your attention here?<br /><br />(whitecoast) Does the thinning veil make it harder for 4D ships to maintain a &quot;fixed&quot; appearance matching the likeness of 3D craft?<br /><br />A: Can.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) What percentage, if we can get a percentage, roughly of the drones that have been cited were &quot;alien&quot; versus human?<br /><br />(L) What percentage of them were alien?<br /><br />A: 37<br /><br />Q: (L) 37 percent.<br /><br />(Joe) That means there were a majority of...<br /><br />(L) Distractions.<br /><br />(Joe) Well, 3D drones. Also, so in that context then, do humans, the government, deep state, whatever, do they have drone technology that is pretty far beyond what most of us here and the average person is aware of?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) Pretty fancy stuff. So is the government using their drones to send signals to people and...?<br /><br />A: Yes and those who have been vaccinated have transmitters and receivers.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So we&#039;re talking here maybe already or very quickly, we&#039;re getting to the point where so-called alien tech and human tech is merging or indistinguishable to some extent, or not indistinguishable, but difficult...<br /><br />(Andromeda) Difficult to distinguish from a distance.<br /><br />Q: (L) Would you say it&#039;s difficult to distinguish without careful analysis?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) So, what else?<br /><br />(Ant22) With Tucker Carlson talking about [the UFO phenomenon] being supernatural in interviews, I guess the material nature of the UFO phenomenon is something they&#039;d want to reinforce.<br /><br />(L) Is that why they&#039;re doing this?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) I&#039;m sure it&#039;s part. Let&#039;s see... Well, we kind of covered that:<br /><br />(Ivan) Are the battery malfunctions that people have reported real? If real, are they related to the aliens or the drones? I am asking because this type of thing has been reported by Simon Hein in his book and related to crop circles or near crop circles. Again, if real, what is it that causes a battery&#039;s charge to drop instantly?<br /><br />(L) We were kind of talking about that cars going off and on and we know about battery malfunctions occur with many UFO interactions. We just kind of covered that. What is it that causes a battery&#039;s charge to drop instantly? Now that&#039;s an interesting question.<br /><br />A: The energy is drawn off into 4D.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Is that a natural function?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) So when there&#039;s a breach in the veil, either naturally or when it&#039;s being blasted by, say, comet fragments or meteors, or when it&#039;s happening because UFOs are breaching it, it causes a loss of energy to 4D?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Is that a natural transference from 3D to 4D? Does that happen at any time there&#039;s a veil breach in that sense?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) But then that energy comes back into 3D from 4D, doesn&#039;t it?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) So there are ways that it comes in and then ways that it goes out. What are some of the ways that it comes in?<br /><br />A: Lightning, for example.<br /><br />Q: (L) All right. Next question:<br /><br />(Saman) Can we know a bit more in general layman terms how this stage of the Wave cycle is causing the thinning of the veil that normally hides hyperdimensional activity from 3D STS beings?<br /><br />A: There are no specific layman terms. But in general just think of 3D merging into 4D.<br /><br />(Joe) Can we, it&#039;s not on the drones, but it may be related to the thinning of the veil. We&#039;re just wondering about Leia who had an accident.<br /><br />(Andromeda) We assume a fall.<br /><br />(Joe) We assume she had a fall, but anyway, she broke two ribs a few days ago. Don&#039;t know how. Outside somewhere. It was anomalous. It was weird. Strange. Was that...<br /><br />(Chu) What happened to her?<br /><br />A: Encounter with energy anomaly.<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) Did this thing cause her to jump or fall or something like that?<br /><br />A: Pushed.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) What was the nature of the energy anomaly?<br /><br />A: Like an energy &quot;wind&quot;.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Is that related to thinning of the veil?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) And did something similar happen to Falkor that same evening?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Was it kind of like a wind that something he ran into or some kind of a...?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) It just hit him?<br /><br />(Joe) So he didn&#039;t see anything. The thing is, he ran off or something as if he was aware of something.<br /><br />A: Animals have a different perception of energy.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So it wasn&#039;t something that was particularly malevolent or benevolent?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (L) But, I mean, you can&#039;t say that a hurricane is malevolent or benevolent, but it...<br /><br />(Niall) Falkor started yelping like he was in pain.<br /><br />(Joe) Well, he ran into something. Something hit him.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Something hit him.<br /><br />(L) Yeah.<br /><br />(Joe) Like an energy wind.<br /><br />(L) Or a blockage or something like that.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Poor little puppies!<br /><br />(Joe) It was more or less outside your window.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, it was outside my office window. It was weird.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Is there anything we can do to protect the puppies against this kind of thing?<br /><br />A: Present times are very unstable for all beings. Awareness and vigilance protect.<br /><br />Q: (L) All right. I have to take a momentary break.<br /><br />[Laura leaves...]<br /><br />(Joe) Poor Leia!<br /><br />(Niall) She was pushed enough by something...<br /><br />(Joe) Deliberately.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Poor little honey... It didn&#039;t make sense that she would fall.<br /><br />(Niall) She must have been on the ledge.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Yeah, she must have been close enough, but I mean, it just doesn&#039;t make sense that she would fall. It&#039;s not slippery. She doesn&#039;t get way up close to the edge unless we&#039;re there.<br /><br />(Niall) An energy wind... Well, the follow-up question would be, are humans subjected to random energy winds as well?<br /><br />(Chu) Probably.<br /><br />(Joe) That&#039;s a good question. Why it would happen with the two dogs as opposed to...<br /><br />(Andromeda) ...to humans.<br /><br />(Niall) And why on the same day?<br /><br />(Andromeda) Right. Oh, we could ask about the starlings.<br /><br />(Ark) I wonder if we are in energy anomaly special zone. I remember these cars crashing nearby for no reason, you know? No one there and weren&#039;t there three? Three accidents.<br /><br />(Andromeda) I think they said it was because there was a bubble over us here.<br /><br />(Joe) A bubble of protection, yeah.<br /><br />(Jefferson) My son&#039;s car flew up in the wind two summers ago, And we asked the Cs.<br /><br />(Andromeda) That&#039;s right!<br /><br />(Jefferson) Yeah, the car flew up and then landed upside down.<br /><br />(Joe) Right.<br /><br />(Jefferson) Some energy difference.<br /><br />(Niall) So yeah, it obviously does hit people then.<br /><br />(Ark) But cars are not driven by animals.<br /><br />(Joe) No, not yet.<br /><br />(Niall) Except in Groundhog Day.<br /><br />(Chu) It could be different types of winds too. Some that affect animals, some that affect people.<br /><br />(Ark) Yeah.<br /><br />(Joe) When the wind is in the east. [Laughter; it&#039;s a reference to the BBC series, &quot;Bleak House&quot;]<br /><br />[Laura returns]<br /><br />(Andromeda) We&#039;ve got two more questions.<br /><br />(L) Oh, I thought of a question too.<br /><br />(Andromeda) You go first.<br /><br />(L) Can these energy winds be created or stimulated by other things such as...? I mean, in our reality, if a helicopter lands on your front lawn, there&#039;s a whole lot of wind. Is there something similar to that with these energy winds? Is it evidence of some other kind of hyperdimensional activity?<br /><br />(Andromeda) Like an effect of something else...<br /><br />(L) Yeah.<br /><br />A: Indeed and usually.<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) And can they affect humans? I mean, this was both of the doggies in one day.<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) Oh, and is there anything to the starlings that have been coming a lot more than usual and landing in our trees?<br /><br />(L) Is there anything, as in what?<br /><br />(Andromeda) As in any energetic related thing?<br /><br />A: Yes. Signs all over the earth.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Do the accidents or the events with the two dogs imply that there was some activity interested in this house here, or at that time?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) And what were they up to?<br /><br />A: Trying to read and influence.<br /><br />Q: (Niall) Was there one of those probes nearby?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Niall) Argh! I never saw it. Why didn&#039;t it show itself? Show your face!<br /><br />(Gaby) I saw, well, I thought I saw a red light, but I figured it was the Christmas lights.<br /><br />(L) So, does the protective bubble we have erected during some of our activities help protect us against things like that?<br /><br />A: For the most part, yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) So we need to shore up our defenses.<br /><br />A: Yes. And stay aware.<br /><br />Q: (L) Okay. All right. Are we done with that? Are we done with that, people?<br /><br />[Attendees on zoom nod]<br /><br />(seek10) One question, Laura: Can 3D drones disappear into thin air? I think that&#039;s part of a Philadelphia experiment.<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (L) I guess if they disappear into thin air, we know they&#039;re alien.<br /><br />(Farmies) Are frequency emitting health bands, such as Wave 1 and Nikki effective treatments against Lyme Disease as is claimed?<br /><br />A: Not likely.<br /><br />Q: (Farmies) Do they also work for other conditions they claim to help?<br /><br />A: Not strong enough to make a difference.<br /><br />(L) All right. Any other questions? Because I wanted this one to be a quick one tonight. We had to do this because of the drones.<br /><br />(Kinyash) Is there any chance that the current &quot;invasion&quot; can cause the deep state to prevent Trump from being inaugurated by instituting Continuity of Government?<br /><br />A: Possible but not likely.<br /><br />Q: (IrjO) Was the guy Luigi the real killer of the CEO of UnitedHealthCare?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (Niall) Wow! So the kid who is in prison now, and was just perp walked yesterday, was framed.<br /><br />(L) Is that it?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Niall) So, who killed him?<br /><br />A: Pro.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Working for Intel agencies?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So the head of the pharma company was taken out because...<br /><br />A: He knew too much and was high risk.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Was that related to vaccines?<br /><br />A: Corruption.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So, what are the chances that this Luigi guy will actually take the fall for it?<br /><br />(L) What do you mean?

Most - if not all - business change management methodologies have some form of a concept of early adopters, i.e. users of a system or people affected by a change who adopt it before others do. They are said to be critical to the success or failure of a new product/process and if guided correctly they have the power to sway other users towards adoption.<br /><br />Another example is Kotter&#039;s 8 steps of change where step 2 is &quot;build a guiding coalition&quot;, i.e., a group of people committed to the change early, and who are born of the group&#039;s own ranks. Step 4 is &quot;enlist a volunteer army&quot; where more and more people are swayed towards a desirable behaviour using people from their own ranks.<br /><br />Looks like the PTB are using exactly the same well tried and tested ideas as a heavily programmed population is an excellent choice of early adopters.

But just feel like there&#039;s a lot in it.. what else could be gleaned from this info?<br /><br />Like, if lightning can be caused by drained energy returning from 4D to 3D.. well how much energy in its original 3D state might it take to form that lightning, once it returns? Is the amount of energy drained consistently commensurate with the amount returned / is the form in which it&#039;s returned consistent?   (could a single little battery being drained &quot;come back&quot; as a lightning bolt? Or would the source energy have to be much more, and a mere battery&#039;s energy only cause some tiny little pop that nobody notices?)  (and is -lightning- <i>always</i> energy being returned in this way?)<br /><br />Batteries contain stored energy.. does all this only apply to electromagnetic stuff? What about kinetic energy? What happens to the energy from a wound spring if it interfaces with 4D? Also what are the mechanics of what happens to the electricity in a human? etc.<br /><br />Can the &quot;form&quot; of the 3D energy before being drained to 4D, when compared to the form when it comes back to 3D (e.g. battery -&gt; lightning) - if we could know such a thing - give us hints to what kind of uh...... energy geometrics(?) such a density translation involves, or what the geometrics (or whatever) are of 4D? I don&#039;t know how to word the question. Basically I mean, can we figure out the structural &quot;shape&quot; of 4D reality by seeing how energy translated there and back again is altered? Maybe useless, dunno, and it&#039;s all way over my head (I assume this kind of thing is something some physicists already work on a lot :)) But I think it&#039;s fascinating, and this session made me see it in a bit of a new light...<br /><br />The part about the energy wind bothering the dogs was so strange.. it reminds me of things from Carlos Castaneda books, e.g. where Don Juan says (IIRC) that when he was young &amp; learning sorcery, one of his &quot;allies&quot; appeared in the form of a whirlwind and whooshed at him across the fields, and he had to grab it and hold on, and was spun and swept away (in some non-ordinary reality kind of a way) - I&#039;m vague on the details, have to re-read.

This may take many forms. The idea is a spiritual one for which we do not have direct terms or perception, thus we look at it through the example of everyday confrontations.<br /><br />One aspect of the idea is <b>not to be drawn into the attacker&#039;s “world” via curiosity, desire to change the world or the attacker, emotional hooks, self-importance or the like.<br /><br />Another aspect is to be internally certain and undivided</b>. In aconfrontation, the attacking party generally expects some reaction, either aggression or backing out. In some cases, <b>mental blocking can take the form of giving no response or an entirely unexpected response. The main idea is not to play by the same playbook as the adversary, thus breaking out of a pattern of expected reactions.</b><br /><br />Getting entangled into arguments or repetitious interactions with people can be draining and as much as one sees the problem in these, it is very difficult not to be affected, thus at least implicitly accepting the rules of the game. Playing various influence games tends to affect one&#039;s FRV and/or one&#039;s basic model of reality. Thus getting dragged into hostile arguments can for example be an attack. <b>Blocking such may involve declining to participate.<br /><br />Attack often works by playing on pre-existing doubts or divisions within the self or within a group.</b> Recognizing this and being unambiguous and not tempted to be swayed is important. “I don&#039;t want to know” is not mental blocking. Knowing things, including the nature and content of the attack is important for an objective view of the world. But once one knows about it, one can decline to again be subjected to the same arguments and simply reject the whole topic as one that has already been seen and dealt with.<br /><br />Declining a confrontation is not always an appropriate strategy, for example truth cannot be defended by being invisible. <b>It is not possible to give fixed rules for every situation. Recognizing appropriate action depends on recognizing the deeper dynamic involved, we could say the nature of the asking. D</b>efending truth where there is no interest for it to begin with is simply wasted time whereas standing up for it when there is a possibility of it being accepted can be a service to the participants.<br /><br />Knowledge of a special kind may itself be a form of protection. Since the battle concerns one&#039;s “soul” or FRV, having drawn one&#039;s circle and standing firm in it may preempt attack. Human knowledge is never absolutely certain or complete, but<b> knowledge through choice to apply it may become something of a different quality. Information is converted into being by the process of commitment. Mental blocking is not a matter of “true belief” but rather of asserting one&#039;s choice also wile faced with attack. </b>This is generally not an aggressive stance, since attack often expects an aggressive response.<br /><br /><b>Acting as a group may be important to the process. A single individual may be worn down by continuously defending one&#039;s position, also a group may focus “higher energies” more effectively than an individual</b>. This is not a case of mob mentality but of<b> strength in unity of purpose.</b> An isolated<br />individual&#039;s mode of thinking and perceiving may more readily be shifted to match the attacker&#039;s, thus diminishing the STO alignment of the attacked.<br /><br />In the case of mental blocking, the point is to preserve one&#039;s own nature, not to adopt that of the attacker. This is not always applicable to physical 3D conflict. We may think that in the context of higher densities, one&#039;s FRV, or polarity along the STO/STS axis determines one&#039;s strength and the realm one occupies. Deviating from one&#039;s chosen polarity represents loss. Sometimes the battle may be a “staring down contest,” sometimes it may not occur at all if the antagonists are naturally kept separate by their different natures.<br /><br />Writings of mystics of the monastic traditions describe something like mental blocking when discussing the spiritual attacks confronted by the monks. The devils seek to confuse, to alternatingly flatter and to induce despair. The defense is not in arguing or engaging but in simultaneously acknowledging that the self is weak yet stands firm in giving thanks and glory to God, regardless of temptation or concern for self. The general advice not to talk to apparitions concerns this.</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote><br />In practical terms, we&#039;re not always faced with a life-altering, personalized 4D STS beaming attack. &#039;Attack&#039; is usually more mundane, I think. Mental blocking in daily life is more about noticing our thought loops, beliefs and bad habits, and then having a clear Aim to overcome them. Then sticking to that Aim. That&#039;s the key - sticking with the aim, even if you don&#039;t like it, because you know it&#039;s good for you.<br /><br />Mental blocking is also expressed really well by G&#039;s student J.G. Bennett. He wrote a <a href=\"https://www.jgbennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1972-74-TSTTS-The-First-Liberation-Freedom-from-Like-and-Dislike-The-Sherborne-Theme-Talks-Series-.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">discourse</a> on the first great liberation - <b>freedom from like and dislike.</b> He puts everything together very well. I think what comes through for me is that the main thing with tackling any habit isn&#039;t just to stop the bad habit. There is a deeper spiritual realization, which is to use the struggle with the habit to find the Observer who notices everything about the situation - the Real &#039;I&#039; within us - who has the power of Free Will choice to identify or not with an automatic impulse. I think that&#039;s what is at stake in tackling any habit - it gives us a chance to become liberated from the victim of the environment and slavery to the Personality. In that sense, it gives us a chance to discover who we truly are - Souls, not bodies.<br /><br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"\" data-quote=\"\" data-source=\"\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">In our moving centre we have the polarity of active and passive states of the body, activity and repose, the di-urnal cycle, and the cycles in all our actions of tension and relaxation. We have in our instinctive centre the reaction of pleasure and pain, pleasant and unpleasant sensations, and because the moving and instinctive centers are so closely linked to one another, there is an alternation of activity and re-pose in the instinctive centre that is hardly distinguishable from the other. We have in our feeling centre the polarity of like and dislike: attraction and repulsion. We have in our intellectual processes assent and dissent, affirmation and denial.This is the crudest mechanism introduced by nature in order to produce fields of force. It is the primary distinction that is introduced into the existing world.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />But the transition to this polar state occurs when something attacks our attention, stimulates us, or we dislike something, or we have a feeling of pain or pleasure, or our curiosity or intellectual activity is stimulated. This mechanism is really provided for the purpose of generating force. It is by keeping the poles of our polar nature apart that we maintain in ourselves a force. When these poles meet this force is dissipated.The first thing to realize and understand about the study of like and dislike is that it does represent a way of life and an attitude towards life that is virtually absent from the modern world. At times this has been taught as a normal thing for man; let us say by the Buddha, by the stoic philosophers. It is taught in the Bhagavad Gita that a normal man mus tnot be a slave to his likes and dislikes. On the contrary, he must know how to make use of the energies of likes and dislikes, and not allow them to make use of him.<br /><br />First look at this to see if it is possible to come to a conclusion about it, whether we wish to be free in relation to likes and dislikes. If we wish to be free, there are ways and means for liberation, although it is no use to show you the ways and means if consciously, or more probably unconsciously, you do not wish to be free. One has to ask oneself the question how can we not wish to be free from it? And there is a big, very significant answer to this when one discovers and sees what it is.<br /><br />Subjection to likes and dislikes really makes people&#039;s lives miserable. And some people it makes very miserable. With others it narrows down and constricts their possible responses to the world. In spite of that, there is something in us that clings to these things and which identifies ourselves. When you hear people saying, as if it were a merit, that they do the things that they like and do not do the things that they dislike, or that they know which people they can get along with and which they cannot and how they are able to keep away from people they cannot get along with and consort with the people they can, as if this were a mark of wisdom; what does it mean? <b>It means one&#039;s shutting oneself off to a whole lot of possible experiences. In the ordinary mechanical way of life, we say we will go along with the things we approve of and avoid the things we disapprove of. Like and dislike is a kind of guardian, a kind of warden that keeps us in prison.</b> As long as we are daunted by this, we remain in the prison of our own imagination. When we are bold enough to walkthrough, we see that the warden has no power to stop us and we can go free.<br /><br />We have to bring this back to ourselves and you will have to look at it and see that you cannot be free from the tendency to take what you can until you can be free from like and dislike. This does not mean that like and dislike ceases. <b>Freedom is not the abolition of desires, but the presence in oneself of something which can choose; which is not drawn towards what it likes, or repelled by what it dislikes, but is able to choose impartially when to take, when to refrain from taking.</b> Only it must be very clear to us that this is not something that one does because one is told, or because there is a moral obligation to do it, but because we can see for ourselves the working of the law.<br /><br />We can study likes and dislikes in terms of attention. Attention in man in a mechanical state simply follows the line of force of his likes and dislikes, his own interests. Just like filings around a magnet, they arrange themselves in the field of force of the magnet. They have no independent position orientation of their own. We have something in us that corresponds to silver, that is not affected by the magnetic field of like and dislike. <b>We have to look and find something in ourselves.</b> That everyone has in him, that is free from like and dislike. It is covered up and crusted over by our habitual reactions, and this in turn has a whole mechanism of justification and explanation. We even lose this power of questioning in ourselves. So automatically it does seem right for us to follow the direction of our likes and dislikes, and we have an inner orientation corresponding to this, instead of having full inward freedom.</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote><br />Like sometimes I spend too much time on the computer. I noticed there is an emotional addiction there at times, and it sure doesn&#039;t feel good to be glued to the screen. So now I&#039;m back to setting a timer for reducing screen time. This is a proactive form of mental blocking - to try to preserve my own nature when the online environment is just so damn interesting that I forget to pay attention to daily life. <br /><br />So mental blocking can and probably should be used for anything - bad diet, reading goals, cold showers, working out, not reacting to some disturbed character who&#039;s trying to rile you up. It&#039;s just another way of talking about developing Free Will. And getting practice with smaller intrusions or habits should help establish the neural pathways for dealing with whatever larger attacks may be planned.<br /><br />Like say a good-looking Nordic Alien comes up to you and says, &quot;No, no, I swear I&#039;m one of the good ones, let&#039;s go for a ride in my cool ship and I&#039;ll show you the cosmos.&quot; <b>Mental blocking!</b>Seems to me that at the core of &quot;mental blocking&quot; is having made a definite choice within oneself.

Was it moving at 2000 miles an hour or something like that?<br /><br />(L) No, it wasn&#039;t, because it was probably closer than you imagine.<br /><br />(Joe) Maybe, but it was moving extremely fast.<br /><br />(Niall) Yes.<br /><br />(Joe) Way faster than any drone you can buy, even the top end, the best of them. And what was this purpose? Was it there to just monitor? Did it have any purpose other than monitoring the situation?<br /><br />A: Mind control signals.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) On Crooks?<br /><br />A: Yes.</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote><br />The line of thought highlighted by the above quotes brings to mind not only the Crooks/UAP assassination attempt, but past discussion of the Greenbaumed people and how some have gone off prematurely. It would seem the &quot;testing of the will&quot; of the heavily programmed NJ population is indeed an assessment of the population&#039;s readiness to either be triggered to commit mass mayhem and/or to readily accept the planned disclosure of benevolent &quot;aliens&quot; returning from a hidden, underground existence in order to save humankind from all the life-threatening circumstances that left unchecked, all but guarantee human extinction! Think of the incidents that have occurred during the last few days - the vehicles being driven into holiday celebrants at Christmas markets and such, an illegal immigrant purposely setting a woman on fire on the subway - these the most egregious to come to mind. Russia&#039;s Oreshnik has failed to quell the nuclear war fervor by the West, and suspicion that bird flu will be the next contrived plague to lock down and terrorize the population with more mandated mind-controlling killer vax. Happy New Year??!<br /><br />I have to say, this drone exposure has certainly enlightened us as to what the military and the secret government actually have developed in drone technology - I had no idea it is so advanced and how truly dangerous drone attack can be particularly with AI now being utilized. The general public doesn&#039;t seem to have this same understanding, though, and probably <i>are</i> being fooled that all the mysterious drones are just government physical aerial vehicles - nothing alien whatsoever . . . maybe. The vax ensuring that the majority believe the false scenario along with the usual mass media/political tactics. Can we counter this false belief via X/twitter and Sott? At least try. Laura has certainly put forth an alternate assessment of what&#039;s happening along with promotion of <i>High Strangeness</i>. The Cs have said we&#039;re having more impact than we realize and I guess ongoing threat to the Chateau also bears this out. Definitely strengthen the protection bubble/defenses!<br /><br />Regarding the nefarious properties of the vax, this may literally <i>shed some light!  <br /><script class=\"js-extraPhrases\" type=\"application/json\">{\"lightbox_close\": \"Close\",\"lightbox_next\": \"Next\",\"lightbox_previous\": \"Previous\",\"lightbox_error\": \"The requested content cannot be loaded.

Mental blocking in daily life is more about noticing our thought loops, beliefs and bad habits, and then having a clear Aim to overcome them. Then sticking to that Aim. That&#039;s the key - sticking with the aim, even if you don&#039;t like it, because you know it&#039;s good for you.<br /><br />Mental blocking is also expressed really well by G&#039;s student J.G. Bennett. He wrote a <a href=\"https://www.jgbennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1972-74-TSTTS-The-First-Liberation-Freedom-from-Like-and-Dislike-The-Sherborne-Theme-Talks-Series-.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">discourse</a> on the first great liberation - <b>freedom from like and dislike.</b> He puts everything together very well. I think what comes through for me is that the main thing with tackling any habit isn&#039;t just to stop the bad habit. There is a deeper spiritual realization, which is to use the struggle with the habit to find the Observer who notices everything about the situation - the Real &#039;I&#039; within us - who has the power of Free Will choice to identify or not with an automatic impulse. I think that&#039;s what is at stake in tackling any habit - it gives us a chance to become liberated from the victim of the environment and slavery to the Personality. In that sense, it gives us a chance to discover who we truly are - Souls, not bodies.<br /><br /><br /><br />Like sometimes I spend too much time on the computer. I noticed there is an emotional addiction there at times, and it sure doesn&#039;t feel good to be glued to the screen. So now I&#039;m back to setting a timer for reducing screen time. This is a proactive form of mental blocking - to try to preserve my own nature when the online environment is just so damn interesting that I forget to pay attention to daily life.<br /><br />So mental blocking can and probably should be used for anything - bad diet, reading goals, cold showers, working out, not reacting to some disturbed character who&#039;s trying to rile you up. It&#039;s just another way of talking about developing Free Will. And getting practice with smaller intrusions or habits should help establish the neural pathways for dealing with whatever larger attacks may be planned.<br /><br />Like say a good-looking Nordic Alien comes up to you and says, &quot;No, no, I swear I&#039;m one of the good ones, let&#039;s go for a ride in my cool ship and I&#039;ll show you the cosmos.&quot; <b>Mental blocking!</b></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote><br />Thanks for the added clarity!

Physiological spiritual union profile would be what defines what tribe you belong to, but it&#039;s a spiritual tribe and not necessarily specifically physical. You can grow into it according to some criteria... “graduate” was the term used. Am I correct here about a tribal group being like a soul group?

If that was a beneficial &#039;sickness&#039; as described (and later it was), it might be no wonder that they had us isolated and locked down, and quickly rolled out a counteraction vax-tech-poison (which, as above, is described in how successful the uptake was).<br /><br />So, from as far back as 1994, the C&#039;s and Laura worked through discussion of the soul, the &quot;Soul composition,&quot; humans as containers, &quot;But it is the soul that matters&quot; et cetera, et cetera. Suddenly, there has been this mass 4d/3d experiment with the human container (to use that word) with a new ability (yet an old plan) to activate through proteins and antenna.<br /><br />It is such a big subject - perhaps the 3d subject of subjects as the C&#039;s let on, and all seems interconnected.<br /><br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 17\" data-quote=\"Laura\" data-source=\"post: 1224188\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1224188\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1224188\">Laura said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">A: <b>Review plans to amalgamate and rule humans after the changes</b>.</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote><br />As said, these are long-term plans as they are, with modifications to realize their 4d endgame.<br /><br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 17\" data-quote=\"Laura\" data-source=\"post: 1224188\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1224188\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1224188\">Laura said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">Q: (L) Pretty fancy stuff.

The Greek adjective is from hexis &quot;a habit (of mind or body),&quot; from ekhein &quot;have, hold, continue&quot; (from PIE root <a href=\"https://www.etymonline.com/word/*segh-\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">*segh-</a> &quot;to hold&quot;). The Latin -h- was restored in English 16c.<br /><br />The use of the word by the Greek physicians apparently was from the notion of a fever rooted in the constitution of the body and symptomatic of one&#039;s physical condition, or else from its continuousness (compare <a href=\"https://www.etymonline.com/word/ephemera\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">ephemera</a>). <i>Hectic</i> fevers are characterized by rapid pulse, flushed cheeks, hot skin, emaciation. In English applied particularly to the wasting fevers, rising and falling with the hours of the day, characteristic of tuberculosis.<br /><br />Sense of &quot;feverishly exciting, full of disorganized activity&quot; is from 1904 and was a vogue word at first, according to Fowler, but <i>hectic</i> also was used in Middle English as a noun meaning &quot;feverish desire, consuming passion&quot; (early 15c.).

Should we stay put or go/move somewhere?<br /><br />I got the impression that these types of questions/plans may have  been discussed in the meditation and SRT groups, but since I haven&#039;t participated in those (mainly due to a hectic family life), I&#039;m not aware of any details.<br /><br />Maybe this could be discussed in a dedicated thread (or is there one already)?<br /><br />Sorry for the alarmist tone, but as a dad of two kids I&#039;m a bit worried. <img src=\"/forum/styles/cass/smilies/smiley.gif\"  class=\"smilie\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile    :-)\" data-shortname=\":-)\" />","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":7509,"user":"candasiri","id":1224364,"date":"2024-12-28T10:52:59+0100","text":"Thank you Laura and the chateau for the session.

Mental blocking in daily life is more about noticing our thought loops, beliefs and bad habits, and then having a clear Aim to overcome them. Then sticking to that Aim. That&#039;s the key - sticking with the aim, even if you don&#039;t like it, because you know it&#039;s good for you.<br /><br />Mental blocking is also expressed really well by G&#039;s student J.G. Bennett. He wrote a <a href=\"https://www.jgbennett.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1972-74-TSTTS-The-First-Liberation-Freedom-from-Like-and-Dislike-The-Sherborne-Theme-Talks-Series-.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">discourse</a> on the first great liberation - <b>freedom from like and dislike.</b> He puts everything together very well. I think what comes through for me is that the main thing with tackling any habit isn&#039;t just to stop the bad habit. There is a deeper spiritual realization, which is to use the struggle with the habit to find the Observer who notices everything about the situation - the Real &#039;I&#039; within us - who has the power of Free Will choice to identify or not with an automatic impulse. I think that&#039;s what is at stake in tackling any habit - it gives us a chance to become liberated from the victim of the environment and slavery to the Personality. In that sense, it gives us a chance to discover who we truly are - Souls, not bodies.<br /><br /><br /><br />Like sometimes I spend too much time on the computer. I noticed there is an emotional addiction there at times, and it sure doesn&#039;t feel good to be glued to the screen. So now I&#039;m back to setting a timer for reducing screen time. This is a proactive form of mental blocking - to try to preserve my own nature when the online environment is just so damn interesting that I forget to pay attention to daily life.<br /><br />So mental blocking can and probably should be used for anything - bad diet, reading goals, cold showers, working out, not reacting to some disturbed character who&#039;s trying to rile you up. It&#039;s just another way of talking about developing Free Will. And getting practice with smaller intrusions or habits should help establish the neural pathways for dealing with whatever larger attacks may be planned.<br /><br />Like say a good-looking Nordic Alien comes up to you and says, &quot;No, no, I swear I&#039;m one of the good ones, let&#039;s go for a ride in my cool ship and I&#039;ll show you the cosmos.&quot; <b>Mental blocking!</b></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote><br />Thanks for the refresher, and for quoting the excellent cass wiki entry.

It would be very interesting, I think, to see what children dream. What are their dreams at night? What do they dream about? Children have more developed senses than we do. We can talk about dreams during lunch, for example, (if we have time!). By talking about dreams we can approach important ideas, about the present, about the future... We can develop their worries, their fears and develop their ideas, and even how to approach the subjects you are talking about.","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":13103,"user":"Evan","id":1224378,"date":"2024-12-28T12:30:42+0100","text":"Grateful for the new session!

But just feel like there&#039;s a lot in it.. what else could be gleaned from this info?<br /><br />Like, if lightning can be caused by drained energy returning from 4D to 3D.. well how much energy in its original 3D state might it take to form that lightning, once it returns? Is the amount of energy drained consistently commensurate with the amount returned / is the form in which it&#039;s returned consistent?   (could a single little battery being drained &quot;come back&quot; as a lightning bolt? Or would the source energy have to be much more, and a mere battery&#039;s energy only cause some tiny little pop that nobody notices?)  (and is -lightning- <i>always</i> energy being returned in this way?)<br /><br />Batteries contain stored energy.. does all this only apply to electromagnetic stuff? What about kinetic energy? What happens to the energy from a wound spring if it interfaces with 4D? Also what are the mechanics of what happens to the electricity in a human? etc.<br /><br />Can the &quot;form&quot; of the 3D energy before being drained to 4D, when compared to the form when it comes back to 3D (e.g. battery -&gt; lightning) - if we could know such a thing - give us hints to what kind of uh...... energy geometrics(?) such a density translation involves, or what the geometrics (or whatever) are of 4D? I don&#039;t know how to word the question. Basically I mean, can we figure out the structural &quot;shape&quot; of 4D reality by seeing how energy translated there and back again is altered? Maybe useless, dunno, and it&#039;s all way over my head (I assume this kind of thing is something some physicists already work on a lot :)) But I think it&#039;s fascinating, and this session made me see it in a bit of a new light...<br /><br />The part about the energy wind bothering the dogs was so strange.. it reminds me of things from Carlos Castaneda books, e.g. where Don Juan says (IIRC) that when he was young &amp; learning sorcery, one of his &quot;allies&quot; appeared in the form of a whirlwind and whooshed at him across the fields, and he had to grab it and hold on, and was spun and swept away (in some non-ordinary reality kind of a way) - I&#039;m vague on the details, have to re-read.

And I suspect in our lifetime it wouldn’t be a huge drastic change since we still will be 3D beings, just with more perception of our environment, kinda like seeing things we weren’t able to and able to manifest some other things, but not much more than that. Maybe we will be fully 4D until we reincarnate with a 4D body in the 4D reality. I could be wrong but that’s how I understand it. So, we can’t know what we would do, if we don’t know exactly what or how that will be, perhaps when the moment comes we would know it. And I don&#039;t see it as a need to have a plan for that anyways, just to let it be as part of universal nature. Perhaps the only plan is to help and guide those who have zero knowledge of what might be going on. <br /><br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 2611\" data-quote=\"aragorn\" data-source=\"post: 1224362\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1224362\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1224362\">aragorn said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">what should I tell my kids if/when things get weird (4D reality) and they get scared/freaked out?

The transition may be gradual (and already happening), or it may lead to a tipping point and a big change. Or it could be everything all at once. But the general plans in place probably hold true - pay attention to reality right and left, non-anticipation, networking, remain skeptical and aware, keep thought loops and emotions in check, take care of the body, good boundaries, external consideration and strategic enclosure in social interactions, etc. In short, apply the Knowledge and maintain your Centre.<br /><br />An added challenge may be some sort of ethereal powers manifesting, like seeing thoughts, seeing entities, manifesting things with thought, etc. There are traps in that, mainly &#039;I&#039;m special&#039; thinking or getting too excited. It may be wild and colourful but maybe it&#039;s best to just do some vagal tone exercises and journal about it? You know, sort of take as a normal development. Maybe a good metaphor is it&#039;s like learning to drive a car. It&#039;s exciting at first and a new world opens up, but there&#039;s also the practical issues of safety and rules of the road, maintenance, gas costs, and insurance companies to deal with.

That&#039;s often the nervous system in flight mode. Historically speaking, lots of people end up dying during large-scale migrations. Better to shelter in place and ride stuff out, OSIT. So that means making your shelter as resilient as possible. But then if your shelter or locale is becoming totally unliveable, then yeah, it makes sense to go.

I would be moving from here soon, but the Finnish group has been thinking quite a bit about where they should focus their energy best to serve the aims and the goals of the Fellowship. We&#039;re feeling a little exposed being in a Northern country with all the climate changes. One of the things that we&#039;re doing at the moment is making a web page and trying to translate a few articles in Finnish with the goal to try to attract more interest from people who speak Finnish.

I always get a bit ‘blue’ during Christmas (thanks to my late alcoholic father who always spoiled the holidays), and all the talks about “things getting hectic”, “wave approaching”, “coming ice age”, “thinning of the veil” etc. got me feeling a bit helpless. I guess we can’t plan that much ahead. When ‘window fallers’ start running in our yard I’ll do my best to stay calm (sorry for the cheeky humor!) <img class=\"smilie smilie--emoji\" alt=\"😀\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f600.png\" title=\"Grinning face    :grinning:\" data-shortname=\":grinning:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" /> <br /><br />I’ve talked to my kids a bit about how things can get more difficult and perhaps weird in the next ten years without going into specifics. I’ve also talked with them about life after death and how I’m convinced that ‘we go on’ after dying and it probably is a wonderful experience after all. The covid years were also a good rehearsal; we managed to stay very calm in our family and often applied humor and jokes to counteract the scare propaganda.","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":4619,"user":"jhonny","id":1224417,"date":"2024-12-28T18:25:30+0100","text":"Great session.

And I suspect in our lifetime it wouldn’t be a huge drastic change since we still will be 3D beings, just with more perception of our environment, kinda like seeing things we weren’t able to and able to manifest some other things, but not much more than that. Maybe we will be fully 4D until we reincarnate with a 4D body in the 4D reality. I could be wrong but that’s how I understand it. So, we can’t know what we would do, if we don’t know exactly what or how that will be, perhaps when the moment comes we would know it. And I don&#039;t see it as a need to have a plan for that anyways, just to let it be as part of universal nature.

Especially good food for thought as the prospect of hyperdimensional agendas, veil thinning, disclosure and 4D transition all loom closer.

This exemplifies that principle that the Radiant being must understand at all times that the Lords of Entropy – the Powers That Be in this reality – will always try to reclaim them as servants. Additionally, belief in the ownership of the land, belief in “being at home” in this world, or being “in charge” of this world, can give a false sense of security to the Radiant being leading them to lower their guard and succumb to the Power of Illusion.<br /><br /><b>With this in mind, the Radiant being should then create an “Enclosure” around their “being.”</b><br /><br />The forces of entropy which govern this reality at present, are much stronger than the powers of resistance of the individual Radiant being. This fact leads us to consider the principle of the enclosure as a psychological policy, in relation to ourselves and to the exterior world, which will allow us to compensate for our lack of strength and available reserves by an appropriate strategy.<br /><br />Because of millennia of cultural and religious conditioning, <b>everything about us is limited,</b> beginning with our nervous resistance. The rule which can be deduced from this is that we must – as much as possible – <b>work silently so as not to draw increased attention and pressure upon ourselves</b> while working on the process of awakening and assimilating knowledge and interior force that can restore us to the Edenic condition. This is true for the average Radiant being, because if he attracts the attention of what Mouravieff calls the General Law that mechanically rules this reality, he will be lost, as the reaction of the ‘World’ against him will be extreme.<br /><br />What the Radiant being must do is to consciously <b>master the material that is part of his interior world – his Belief Centers</b> – by gaining sufficient knowledge to be able to exercise perspicacity and SEEing. This enables him to divide that which he perceives and to choose that which is assimilated, or “enters within” his “strategic enclosure.” This allows him to accumulate force and put it in reserve. <b>When the false beliefs, the illusions of this world, no longer have any part within the Radiant Being, then he will be able to step out of the flow of Linear Time.</b><br /><br />The principle of the strategic enclosure is, then, <b>that the individual or group must initially work silently to create this enclosure, without drawing the attention of the forces of life of this world to himself.</b> These forces are systematically hostile to anyone who persistently searches for the Truth.<br /><br />There are two parts to the Strategic Enclosure:<b> The first is to shelter oneself physically from the harmful influence of the ‘World’ as much as possible.</b> Gurdjieff referred to this as the activity of the “sly man.” Unfortunately, this has often been twisted to mean the “monastic life” or “withdrawal from the world” which is an essentially useless approach when the thing that needs most to be learned is the objective truth of the reality in which we live.<br /><br /><b>The second part of the Strategic Enclosure is that the shelter must be built in his inner world.</b> Mouravieff writes that “The picturesque language of the Tradition says that <b>man must build a cage in himself. </b>This must be provided with all means of connection with and direction of the centres. It must also be solid enough to effectively resist all rebellions of the little ‘I’s’, singly or ‘federated’. This construction takes time. <b>To play its role as an organ of direction, it must be continually enlarged, improved and perfected.”</b><br /><br />In other words, the Strategic Enclosure is an allegory that refers to <b>an ontological state where the individual basically declares his independence from the Law of Entropy that seems to govern the Material Universe.</b> Using the concepts explained by Mouravieff, this state could also be described as a manifestation of a resolution to shut oneself up to the influences of illusion and instead open only to those influences that lead one to objectivity.<br /><br />The Creative Hyperdimensional Wisdom claimed that <b>once having “enclosed the land occupied,” the people then could cultivate it and make it produce fruits.</b> This, again, must be understood allegorically – even if the end result may be quite material. This is also reflected in alchemical metaphors as well as in one of the most famous examples given by Jesus: the miracle of the loaves and fishes which is merely an example of the fact that Jesus was a master of the Creative Hyperdimensional Wisdom which had expressed this principle in many other allegories including that of the Head of Bran and the Cauldron of Regeneration.&#8203;</div><br />The principle of the <b>Strategic Wall </b>is, in its more immediate meaning, the practical application of the principle of Enclosure, however the fact that there are different manifestations of this strategic wall depending on the realm to which it is applied is made clear by the fact that there are many worlds where the Spirit remains captive and in each one of them the principle of the Strategic Wall supposes a different manifestation.<br /><br />It could be said that, in the physical world the correct application might lead to construction of a Stone Wall, but one must understand that the definition of a “Stone Wall”, as manifested in the physical realm, <b>should not be constricted to the idea of a<i>spatially closed wall</i>.</b> There are obviously many principles that belong to “Lithic Wisdom”, which suggest that that a “stone wall” is related to the emplacement of <b>megaliths in very specific layouts for the purpose of creating a grid that may have served, as one of its purposes, to protect the enclosed space from the influence of the Entropic Principle.<br /><br />The Strategic Enclosure, then, aims at the innermost part of each man, creating a space in which awakening can take place.</b> This awakening calls to them, and through their blood connections it calls to all others who are of the Radiant lineage, to cease their march along the “evolutionary” or “progressive” path of History and to rebel against the Laws of Entropy that reduce all to primal matter. <b>Awakening induces the Radiant ones to take a leap in the opposite direction and transmute man’s “animal tendencies” [the reactive machine programs of Gurdjieff, the Predator of Don Juan, the confluence with the General Law of Mouravieff] and claim back their divine Hyperdimensional nature.</b></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>Entire Cassiopaean encyclopedia in one PDF. <br /><br /><div class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--unfurl    js-unfurl fauxBlockLink\"data-unfurl=\"true\" data-result-id=\"34631\" data-url=\"https://cassiopaea.org/forum/resources/casswiki-pdf.6/\" data-host=\"cassiopaea.org\" data-pending=\"false\"><div class=\"contentRow\"><div class=\"contentRow-figure contentRow-figure--fixedSmall js-unfurl-figure\"><img src=\"https://cassiopaea.org/forum/img/FB_sky.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"cassiopaea.org\" class=\"bbCodeBlockUnfurl-image\" data-onerror=\"hide-parent\"/></div><div class=\"contentRow-main\"><h3 class=\"contentRow-header js-unfurl-title\"><a href=\"https://cassiopaea.org/forum/resources/casswiki-pdf.6/\"class=\"link link--internal fauxBlockLink-blockLink\"target=\"\"rel=\"\"data-proxy-href=\"\">FOTCM - CassWiki PDF</a></h3><div class=\"contentRow-snippet js-unfurl-desc\">Entire Cassiopaean encyclopedia in one PDF.</div><div class=\"contentRow-minor contentRow-minor--hideLinks\"><span class=\"js-unfurl-favicon\"><img src=\"https://cassiopaea.org/forum/styles/cass/img/favicon.png\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"cassiopaea.org\" class=\"bbCodeBlockUnfurl-icon\"data-onerror=\"hide-parent\"/></span>cassiopaea.org</div></div></div></div>","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":3193,"user":"seek10","id":1224438,"date":"2024-12-28T21:22:54+0100","text":"<blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 14284\" data-quote=\"iamthatis\" data-source=\"post: 1224435\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1224435\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1224435\">iamthatis said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">Next time ask Casswiki!</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote><br /><a href=\"http://www.casswiki.net\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">casswiki.net </a> site is up and running.

It is impossible to say where is the end of all this and where the way out— or whether there is an end and a way out. One thing alone is certain, that man&#039;s slavery grows and increases. Man is becoming a willing slave. He no longer needs chains. He begins to grow fond of his slavery, to be proud of it. And this is the most terrible thing that can happen to a man.<br /><br />The plan to control humanity is bearing fruit people are mainly thinking of how to maintain peace and happiness.

I&#039;m intrigued to know &quot;how&quot; the will was tested, through those antennas, that is, there is a person with antennas and to test if it is working well you have to issue a command, induce an order, a mental state, a behavior, an emotion, etc. to know if the receiver works or not, right?

No reason not to.<br /><br />(L) I reckon!<br /><br />A: We are here, do not fear. Milonnioa of Cassiopaea.<br /><br />Q: (L) Whatever. All right. So I guess the big question on everybody&#039;s mind as NiallyBob just put it a minute ago, &quot;How about those drones?!&quot; I think we better break it down into a little bit better questions than that. Are the drones a strictly human-originated phenomenon?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (L) Are some of the drones, say, hyperdimensional for lack of a... hyperdimensional, alien, or whatever?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) Is there a visible difference between the human origin drones and the hyperdimensional drones?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) Why are they appearing in such great numbers and over such a wide area and apparently for a long time period? Yeah, so I&#039;m asking why?<br /><br />A: Many reasons depending on which time, place, and context. Closest description is human origin drones are meant to distract from &quot;alien&quot; drones and probes.<br /><br />Q: (L) What are the alien drones or probes up to?<br /><br />A: Psychic reading and influencing of selected populations.<br /><br />Q: (L) Is there any significance to the fact that this has happened kind of repeatedly over a period of at least five years at approximately the same time of the year?<br /><br />(Andromeda) Well, from what I understand, the last three years have been at the same time of year.<br /><br />(L) Last three years.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Right. And then before that there was one in July or something.<br /><br />(Joe) Here&#039;s the thing: A year ago, almost a year ago, and the year before, there were drones sighted over Langley Air Force Base. Last year for 17 days.<br /><br />(Chu) There was one in December-January, 2019 according to Approaching Infinity.<br /><br />(Joe) Yeah, I mean, you can go back quite a long time for sightings over military bases. You can go back to the sixties if you want. So the question is whether or not the sightings, for example one year ago over Langley Air Force Base, have anything to do with what&#039;s happening today? Or is that a separate...?<br /><br />(L) So are they all related in some way?<br /><br />A: Similar.<br /><br />Q: (L) So they&#039;re there for reading and influencing of selected populations?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Over a military base.<br /><br />(Niall) Specifically military populations?<br /><br />(Joe) Only a military base.<br /><br />(L) Is it specifically military or, okay... Is it only military?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) They were also spotted over two US military bases in the UK, and one in Germany, both this year in November.<br /><br />(Chu) And if you count the orbs, then it&#039;s more widespread.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Well, were those the same kind of thing in the UK and in Germany?<br /><br />A: Close<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So maybe a question is: Given that drones have been sighted over various military bases - and drones as in UFOs, they may be drones, maybe UFOs - over military bases going back many years up until last year. What is the significance of such a widespread phenomenon over the past month?<br /><br />A: Acclimatising the public.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) That&#039;s what I thought. So that was the specific agenda in it being such a widespread phenomenon.<br /><br />(L) Okay, do they also... I mean, I understand that probably a lot of them are... Maybe the reason they&#039;re so plentiful at this point in time is because gradually human beings have built up their stockpile of such drones so they can send them up to confuse things even better than they could before. Is that part of it?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So this would be acclimatizing the public to an eventual disclosure of &quot;aliens&quot;?<br /><br />A: Eventually. But spooking the population is also seen as desirable.<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) They&#039;re trying to spook people.<br /><br />(PoB) It just about spooking or there are other influencing causes or reasons?<br /><br />(L) I think that the human-created drones are seen as being useful for spooking because they put &#039;em up there, they know what they are, they&#039;re in control of &#039;em, but they deny it. And of course that&#039;s like doing the whole COVID thing. People could see stuff in front of their eyes, and it was just being denied. What do they call it?<br /><br />(Andromeda) It&#039;s gaslighting.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, gaslighting.<br /><br />(Joe) So is it true to say that this was like a &quot;aliens&quot; plan to have these drones or craft fly around and then the military, the government, deep state, whatever, decided to put theirs up when they realized it was happening to muddy the waters? Is that a reasonable...?<br /><br />A: Close<br /><br />Q: (Joe) And with all the denials from the government saying there&#039;s nothing going on here, do they actually know fully what is going on?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) They know at least partially that it&#039;s...<br /><br />(L) They know what they&#039;re doing and they know that the aliens are doing something, but they don&#039;t really fully know what the aliens are doing.<br /><br />(Andromeda) What their plan is...<br /><br />(Joe) No, but the question is...<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) Have they tried to shoot one down?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) So people like the Pentagon spoke, at that level of government, ya know, overt government figures... Did they know of this alien presence?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Gaby) So why are the aliens doing it now?<br /><br />A: Part of ongoing plans falling into place. [ferocious dogs growl and bark during answer :)]<br /><br />Q: (L) And I guess we&#039;ve already been told what those plans are.<br /><br />(Joe) Well, are they? Do we? Have we?<br /><br />(L) We have been a number of times.<br /><br />(Joe) Long term or short term?<br /><br />(L) So, you say that they want to influence and read...<br /><br />(Andromeda) And that&#039;s part of a larger plan.<br /><br />(L) Influence and read...<br /><br />(seek10) Can we ask why New Jersey is the spot?<br /><br />A: Heavily programmed population there.<br /><br />Q: (L) Where is that place where they had all those weird experiments going on? Montauk! Where is Montauk in relation to New Jersey?<br /><br />(Joe) Isn&#039;t that New York?<br /><br />(Niall) Long Island, no?<br /><br />[Montauk is a hamlet located at the eastern tip of Long Island, New York]<br /><br />(L) Does Montauk have anything to do with any of this?<br /><br />A: Yes. It is all interrelated.<br /><br />Q: (L) So my guess is that they have people there that are programmed to do things and that they&#039;re interested in determining if they&#039;re ready to perform their programmed activities or if they need additional programming... Okay... Are they planning to turn people on or off in terms of programming?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Surely reading and influencing of members of the population could be done without such a visible display of lights in the sky and stuff. So it seems that the main agenda here is obviously to spook the population and prepare them, like I said, acclimatize them to lights in the sky, UFOs...<br /><br />A: Also, the invisibility granted by a firmly structured density veil is not as secure as previously.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Okay. So it&#039;s likely that a lot more of these things are going to be seen around the world.<br /><br />(L) So does that mean that when people have in the past or in other times and places been read and influenced and so forth - we kind of joke about it as being like the cryptogeographic being - that what&#039;s actually happening is some kind of orbs or something are nearby, only they are concealed from view because the veil is more secure. Is that it?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) So with the veil being less secure, or &quot;thinning&quot; as we call it, that means that a lot more of this type of activity is visually seen and probably will be seen elsewhere - as well as other things that ordinarily would be concealed by the veil. Is that true?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So this is setting up an explanation in advance for that phenomenon being more visible, that people will say, &quot;Oh, it&#039;s just like in New Jersey: It was drones.&quot; It&#039;s a pretty poor effort on the part of government to convince people these are just drones. I mean, I suppose it&#039;s the best they can do, but...<br /><br />(Chu) Well, they&#039;re also telling people, even if they do say they&#039;re aliens, they&#039;re saying, &quot;They&#039;re benevolent! See, they&#039;re not doing anything to you!&quot;<br /><br />(L) Yeah. And the other thing is they&#039;re also trying to really reinforce the idea that it is a totally physical phenomenon. Because I mean, really covering up the highly strange nature of these things is one of their main goals and tricks.<br /><br />(Joe) But surely the &quot;aliens&quot; have the ability to always make it appear as if it&#039;s a physical phenomenon?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (Joe) They don&#039;t always have the ability to appear as drones or lights in the sky?<br /><br />(L) Actually, if you think about it, all the UFO sightings that have been proven to be, or shown to be really legit have always had high strangeness associated with them.<br /><br />(Joe) But not the ones in New Jersey recently.<br /><br />(L) But we&#039;re talking about human-made drones.<br /><br />(Joe) I&#039;m talking about alien drones that are appearing as - generally speaking - as a drone, a drone type object. People are saying that doesn&#039;t look like a plane. It&#039;s too small, it&#039;s weird, et cetera, et cetera. So they&#039;re not able to make it look exactly like a drone. But they do seem to be able to manifest as something that people see as a physical object, albeit a bit strange looking.<br /><br />A: Some of those are human made decoys.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Right.<br /><br />(Chu) And then there&#039;s the weird orbs and stuff that don&#039;t look very human.<br /><br />(Joe) Well, there are a few, but the vast majority are ambiguous.<br /><br />(Andromeda) There&#039;s a mixed bag.<br /><br />(Niall) There&#039;s been a lot of videos of lights flashing on and off.<br /><br />(L) So somebody on the chat wants to know if the UFOs want to gauge how aware the population is getting? Um, do they want to...?<br /><br />A: Testing of the will, yes.<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) And also probably testing for the reaction to that kind of thing.<br /><br />(L) So what were you saying, Niall?<br /><br />(Niall) There are lots of videos people are posting. We don&#039;t know, but they claim to be associated with drones or in the areas where these drones are seen, where either street lights or car lights or building lights are not just flashing, they&#039;re blinking on and off.<br /><br />(Joe) And radio interference.<br /><br />(Niall) Is this associated with the sightings in the sky at all?<br /><br />(L) Your question is really loose. Is this associated with the drones? Or is it associated with the alien craft? I mean, make a distinction here. There&#039;s all kinds of shit going on in the sky.<br /><br />(Niall) I don&#039;t assume that it&#039;s associated with any of it. I don&#039;t know if it is. That&#039;s why I wanna go one first, then the next.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Could it be associated with the human decoy drones, the alien craft, or even part of this thinning of the veil? Weather phenomenon?<br /><br />(L) Yeah.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Is it associated with any of those?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) Which one?<br /><br />A: All sometimes.<br /><br />Q: (L) But we know from case histories that UFOs make cars stop, make things blink, etc. I mean, we&#039;ve seen that repeatedly in the case histories. We also know that overflying comet or meteorite fragments can cause all the car alarms in a neighborhood to go off, as well as all of the garage doors to open and close and so forth because there&#039;s electromagnetic anomalies. And we also know it can happen from weather. So, you&#039;d have to take a particular case in order to get an answer, a particular case and say, was this one due to whatever. Because if it&#039;s happening and the drones are there at the time, we may assume that it&#039;s associated.<br /><br />(Niall) Okay. Well, then let&#039;s assume, okay.<br /><br />(Joe) They said that it was part of an ongoing plan falling into place. Is that a long-term plan, or does this happening now in recent weeks have anything to do with... Is it related in any way to Trump becoming president and something that&#039;s planned for that? Or is it a longer term acclimatization only?<br /><br />A: As previously noted, there was a change in plans, thus some recalibration is needed.<br /><br />Q: (L) So... Okay, let me ask this: Is this activity beneficial to human beings?<br /><br />A: Decidedly not.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Why not?<br /><br />A: Review plans to amalgamate and rule humans after the changes.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) But that was going to happen... Okay, so it&#039;s just part of that longer term plan then.<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) And that was always going to happen, correct?<br /><br />(L) That&#039;s always been their plan, but...<br /><br />(Andromeda) Barring something that changed it, I suppose.<br /><br />(Joe) The C&#039;s have talked about that from day one.<br /><br />(Gaby) Does the current thinning of the veil that&#039;s going on now have anything to do with the 19-year lunar cycle in some sense?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (L) Can the 19-year lunar cycle be associated with a thinning of the veil?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) But not necessarily always. Can the 19-year lunar cycle be utilized in some way to open portals into our reality and that sort of thing?<br /><br />A: Yes indeed!<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) So what is the current thinning of the veil due to?<br /><br />A: Wave.<br /><br />Q: (Gaby) Well, I have a question about the lunar cycle. Is the next major lunar standstill on March 22, 2025 when we could potentially channel some positive energies through gravitational forces?<br /><br />A: Yes!<br /><br />Q: (L) So we should make a plan for the lunar standstill in March. Keep that in mind, everybody! Okay. Are we done with the drones?<br /><br />Q: (Chu) You want to see if any of the questions on the chat catch your attention here?<br /><br />(whitecoast) Does the thinning veil make it harder for 4D ships to maintain a &quot;fixed&quot; appearance matching the likeness of 3D craft?<br /><br />A: Can.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) What percentage, if we can get a percentage, roughly of the drones that have been cited were &quot;alien&quot; versus human?<br /><br />(L) What percentage of them were alien?<br /><br />A: 37<br /><br />Q: (L) 37 percent.<br /><br />(Joe) That means there were a majority of...<br /><br />(L) Distractions.<br /><br />(Joe) Well, 3D drones. Also, so in that context then, do humans, the government, deep state, whatever, do they have drone technology that is pretty far beyond what most of us here and the average person is aware of?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) Pretty fancy stuff. So is the government using their drones to send signals to people and...?<br /><br />A: Yes and those who have been vaccinated have transmitters and receivers.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So we&#039;re talking here maybe already or very quickly, we&#039;re getting to the point where so-called alien tech and human tech is merging or indistinguishable to some extent, or not indistinguishable, but difficult...<br /><br />(Andromeda) Difficult to distinguish from a distance.<br /><br />Q: (L) Would you say it&#039;s difficult to distinguish without careful analysis?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) So, what else?<br /><br />(Ant22) With Tucker Carlson talking about [the UFO phenomenon] being supernatural in interviews, I guess the material nature of the UFO phenomenon is something they&#039;d want to reinforce.<br /><br />(L) Is that why they&#039;re doing this?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) I&#039;m sure it&#039;s part. Let&#039;s see... Well, we kind of covered that:<br /><br />(Ivan) Are the battery malfunctions that people have reported real? If real, are they related to the aliens or the drones? I am asking because this type of thing has been reported by Simon Hein in his book and related to crop circles or near crop circles. Again, if real, what is it that causes a battery&#039;s charge to drop instantly?<br /><br />(L) We were kind of talking about that cars going off and on and we know about battery malfunctions occur with many UFO interactions. We just kind of covered that. What is it that causes a battery&#039;s charge to drop instantly? Now that&#039;s an interesting question.<br /><br />A: The energy is drawn off into 4D.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Is that a natural function?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) So when there&#039;s a breach in the veil, either naturally or when it&#039;s being blasted by, say, comet fragments or meteors, or when it&#039;s happening because UFOs are breaching it, it causes a loss of energy to 4D?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Is that a natural transference from 3D to 4D? Does that happen at any time there&#039;s a veil breach in that sense?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) But then that energy comes back into 3D from 4D, doesn&#039;t it?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) So there are ways that it comes in and then ways that it goes out. What are some of the ways that it comes in?<br /><br />A: Lightning, for example.<br /><br />Q: (L) All right. Next question:<br /><br />(Saman) Can we know a bit more in general layman terms how this stage of the Wave cycle is causing the thinning of the veil that normally hides hyperdimensional activity from 3D STS beings?<br /><br />A: There are no specific layman terms. But in general just think of 3D merging into 4D.<br /><br />(Joe) Can we, it&#039;s not on the drones, but it may be related to the thinning of the veil. We&#039;re just wondering about Leia who had an accident.<br /><br />(Andromeda) We assume a fall.<br /><br />(Joe) We assume she had a fall, but anyway, she broke two ribs a few days ago. Don&#039;t know how. Outside somewhere. It was anomalous. It was weird. Strange. Was that...<br /><br />(Chu) What happened to her?<br /><br />A: Encounter with energy anomaly.<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) Did this thing cause her to jump or fall or something like that?<br /><br />A: Pushed.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) What was the nature of the energy anomaly?<br /><br />A: Like an energy &quot;wind&quot;.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Is that related to thinning of the veil?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) And did something similar happen to Falcor that same evening?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Was it kind of like a wind that something he ran into or some kind of a...?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) It just hit him?<br /><br />(Joe) So he didn&#039;t see anything. The thing is, he ran off or something as if he was aware of something.<br /><br />A: Animals have a different perception of energy.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So it wasn&#039;t something that was particularly malevolent or benevolent?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (L) But, I mean, you can&#039;t say that a hurricane is malevolent or benevolent, but it...<br /><br />(Niall) Falcor started yelping like he was in pain.<br /><br />(Joe) Well, he ran into something. Something hit him.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Something hit him.<br /><br />(L) Yeah.<br /><br />(Joe) Like an energy wind.<br /><br />(L) Or a blockage or something like that.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Poor little puppies!<br /><br />(Joe) It was more or less outside your window.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, it was outside my office window. It was weird.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Is there anything we can do to protect the puppies against this kind of thing?<br /><br />A: Present times are very unstable for all beings. Awareness and vigilance protect.<br /><br />Q: (L) All right. I have to take a momentary break.<br /><br />[Laura leaves...]<br /><br />(Joe) Poor Leia!<br /><br />(Niall) She was pushed enough by something...<br /><br />(Joe) Deliberately.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Poor little honey... It didn&#039;t make sense that she would fall.<br /><br />(Niall) She must have been on the ledge.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Yeah, she must have been close enough, but I mean, it just doesn&#039;t make sense that she would fall. It&#039;s not slippery. She doesn&#039;t get way up close to the edge unless we&#039;re there.<br /><br />(Niall) An energy wind... Well, the follow-up question would be, are humans subjected to random energy winds as well?<br /><br />(Chu) Probably.<br /><br />(Joe) That&#039;s a good question. Why it would happen with the two dogs as opposed to...<br /><br />(Andromeda) ...to humans.<br /><br />(Niall) And why on the same day?<br /><br />(Andromeda) Right. Oh, we could ask about the starlings.<br /><br />(Ark) I wonder if we are in energy anomaly special zone. I remember these cars crashing nearby for no reason, you know? No one there and weren&#039;t there three? Three accidents.<br /><br />(Andromeda) I think they said it was because there was a bubble over us here.<br /><br />(Joe) A bubble of protection, yeah.<br /><br />(Jefferson) My son&#039;s car flew up in the wind two summers ago, And we asked the Cs.<br /><br />(Andromeda) That&#039;s right!<br /><br />(Jefferson) Yeah, the car flew up and then landed upside down.<br /><br />(Joe) Right.<br /><br />(Jefferson) Some energy difference.<br /><br />(Niall) So yeah, it obviously does hit people then.<br /><br />(Ark) But cars are not driven by animals.<br /><br />(Joe) No, not yet.<br /><br />(Niall) Except in Groundhog Day.<br /><br />(Chu) It could be different types of winds too. Some that affect animals, some that affect people.<br /><br />(Ark) Yeah.<br /><br />(Joe) When the wind is in the east. [Laughter; it&#039;s a reference to the BBC series, &quot;Bleak House&quot;]<br /><br />[Laura returns]<br /><br />(Andromeda) We&#039;ve got two more questions.<br /><br />(L) Oh, I thought of a question too.<br /><br />(Andromeda) You go first.<br /><br />(L) Can these energy winds be created or stimulated by other things such as...? I mean, in our reality, if a helicopter lands on your front lawn, there&#039;s a whole lot of wind. Is there something similar to that with these energy winds? Is it evidence of some other kind of hyperdimensional activity?<br /><br />(Andromeda) Like an effect of something else...<br /><br />(L) Yeah.<br /><br />A: Indeed and usually.<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) And can they affect humans? I mean, this was both of the doggies in one day.<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) Oh, and is there anything to the starlings that have been coming a lot more than usual and landing in our trees?<br /><br />(L) Is there anything, as in what?<br /><br />(Andromeda) As in any energetic related thing?<br /><br />A: Yes. Signs all over the earth.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Do the accidents or the events with the two dogs imply that there was some activity interested in this house here, or at that time?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) And what were they up to?<br /><br />A: Trying to read and influence.<br /><br />Q: (Niall) Was there one of those probes nearby?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Niall) Argh! I never saw it. Why didn&#039;t it show itself? Show your face!<br /><br />(Gaby) I saw, well, I thought I saw a red light, but I figured it was the Christmas lights.<br /><br />(L) So, does the protective bubble we have erected during some of our activities help protect us against things like that?<br /><br />A: For the most part, yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) So we need to shore up our defenses.<br /><br />A: Yes. And stay aware.<br /><br />Q: (L) Okay. All right. Are we done with that? Are we done with that, people?<br /><br />[Attendees on zoom nod]<br /><br />(seek10) One question, Laura: Can 3D drones disappear into thin air? I think that&#039;s part of a Philadelphia experiment.<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (L) I guess if they disappear into thin air, we know they&#039;re alien.<br /><br />(Farmies) Are frequency emitting health bands, such as Wave 1 and Nikki effective treatments against Lyme Disease as is claimed?<br /><br />A: Not likely.<br /><br />Q: (Farmies) Do they also work for other conditions they claim to help?<br /><br />A: Not strong enough to make a difference.<br /><br />(L) All right. Any other questions? Because I wanted this one to be a quick one tonight. We had to do this because of the drones.<br /><br />(Kinyash) Is there any chance that the current &quot;invasion&quot; can cause the deep state to prevent Trump from being inaugurated by instituting Continuity of Government?<br /><br />A: Possible but not likely.<br /><br />Q: (IrjO) Was the guy Luigi the real killer of the CEO of UnitedHealthCare?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (Niall) Wow! So the kid who is in prison now, and was just perp walked yesterday, was framed.<br /><br />(L) Is that it?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Niall) So, who killed him?<br /><br />A: Pro.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Working for Intel agencies?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So the head of the pharma company was taken out because...<br /><br />A: He knew too much and was high risk.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Was that related to vaccines?<br /><br />A: Corruption.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So, what are the chances that this Luigi guy will actually take the fall for it?<br /><br />(L) What do you mean? What&#039;s your question?<br /><br />(Joe) Will they be successful in prosecuting him and putting the blame on him?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Poor guy.<br /><br />(Andromeda and Gaby) Yeah.<br /><br />(Joe) Because he wasn&#039;t there, obviously.<br /><br />(Niall) He wasn&#039;t there. It was someone else. And people saw that! It was so obvious...<br /><br />A: Steamrolled.<br /><br />Q: (L) So, steamrolled instead of railroaded.<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Scottie) That&#039;s why there was... there was a picture going around on social media where he had peed his pants and somebody made a joke out of it and said, &quot;Oh, first you assassinated the CEO, and then you peed your pants!&quot; I&#039;m like, well, yeah, maybe that&#039;s because he didn&#039;t do it. I might have peed my pants too.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Yeah...<br /><br />(L) All right. Is there anything we need to know that we didn&#039;t ask?<br /><br />A: Stay alert. Things can get hectic! Goodbye.<br /><br />(Scottie) That&#039;s the understatement of the year!<br /><br />(L) Yeah, we know that! Well, well, well, drones, a complicated topic. Poor Luigi.<br /><br />END OF SESSION</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote><br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 17\" data-quote=\"Laura\" data-source=\"post: 1224188\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1224188\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1224188\">Laura said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">Session Date: December 21st 2024<br /><br />Laura and Andromeda at the board<br /><br />Niall, Joe, Gaby, Ark, PoB, Chu, Scottie, Princess Leia, Bella, Falcor, The Lunar Module<br /><br />FOTCM Members attending via Zoom:<br /><br />3DStudent, A Jay, Abats, Adobe US, aimarok, Alana, Alejo, Aliana, Altair, Ana Huitzil, Anamarija, anartist, Andrian, Ant22, Approaching Infinity, Arwenn, Aya, Beau, Bluefyre, Bobo08, brandon, Breton, Cosmos, Deliverance, Dirgni, domi, dugdeep, fabric, finduilas495, France, Gawan, Glenn, Gottathink, Gwellian, Harmony99, Herondancer, Hesper, hesperides, hiker, hlat&amp;his wife, iamthatis, irjO, iscreamsandwish, Ivan_, Jacques, JeanneT, JEEP, Jefferson, Jenn, Josi, Juba, Keyhole, Kinyash, KJN, Konstantin, korzik18, Kosma, Laurentien2, Laurs, Lilou, loreta, LQB, Luis Miguel, marek760, Mari , Mark, Mark7, Martina, Meg, Mililea, Miracle, mkrnhr, Mrs. Peel, Natus Videre, Navigator, Nicholas, Nienna, Obi, Ollie, OrangeScorpion, Oxajil, Pecha, Pophistorian, Puma, RedFox, Redrock12, Regulattor , Ryan, rylek, Ryu, Saman, seek10, seeker2seer, Stoneboss, sToRmR1dR, Temperance, Timótheos, Tristan, Turgon, voyageur, whitecoast, Windmill knight, Yas, Z…, Zar, Zim<br /><br />Q: (L) I guess we&#039;re just going to do it, huh?<br /><br />(Andromeda) Guess so. No reason not to.<br /><br />(L) I reckon!<br /><br />A: We are here, do not fear. Milonnioa of Cassiopaea.<br /><br />Q: (L) Whatever. All right. So I guess the big question on everybody&#039;s mind as NiallyBob just put it a minute ago, &quot;How about those drones?!&quot; I think we better break it down into a little bit better questions than that. Are the drones a strictly human-originated phenomenon?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (L) Are some of the drones, say, hyperdimensional for lack of a... hyperdimensional, alien, or whatever?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) Is there a visible difference between the human origin drones and the hyperdimensional drones?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) Why are they appearing in such great numbers and over such a wide area and apparently for a long time period? Yeah, so I&#039;m asking why?<br /><br />A: Many reasons depending on which time, place, and context. Closest description is human origin drones are meant to distract from &quot;alien&quot; drones and probes.<br /><br />Q: (L) What are the alien drones or probes up to?<br /><br />A: Psychic reading and influencing of selected populations.<br /><br />Q: (L) Is there any significance to the fact that this has happened kind of repeatedly over a period of at least five years at approximately the same time of the year?<br /><br />(Andromeda) Well, from what I understand, the last three years have been at the same time of year.<br /><br />(L) Last three years.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Right. And then before that there was one in July or something.<br /><br />(Joe) Here&#039;s the thing: A year ago, almost a year ago, and the year before, there were drones sighted over Langley Air Force Base. Last year for 17 days.<br /><br />(Chu) There was one in December-January, 2019 according to Approaching Infinity.<br /><br />(Joe) Yeah, I mean, you can go back quite a long time for sightings over military bases. You can go back to the sixties if you want. So the question is whether or not the sightings, for example one year ago over Langley Air Force Base, have anything to do with what&#039;s happening today? Or is that a separate...?<br /><br />(L) So are they all related in some way?<br /><br />A: Similar.<br /><br />Q: (L) So they&#039;re there for reading and influencing of selected populations?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Over a military base.<br /><br />(Niall) Specifically military populations?<br /><br />(Joe) Only a military base.<br /><br />(L) Is it specifically military or, okay... Is it only military?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) They were also spotted over two US military bases in the UK, and one in Germany, both this year in November.<br /><br />(Chu) And if you count the orbs, then it&#039;s more widespread.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Well, were those the same kind of thing in the UK and in Germany?<br /><br />A: Close<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So maybe a question is: Given that drones have been sighted over various military bases - and drones as in UFOs, they may be drones, maybe UFOs - over military bases going back many years up until last year. What is the significance of such a widespread phenomenon over the past month?<br /><br />A: Acclimatising the public.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) That&#039;s what I thought. So that was the specific agenda in it being such a widespread phenomenon.<br /><br />(L) Okay, do they also... I mean, I understand that probably a lot of them are... Maybe the reason they&#039;re so plentiful at this point in time is because gradually human beings have built up their stockpile of such drones so they can send them up to confuse things even better than they could before. Is that part of it?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So this would be acclimatizing the public to an eventual disclosure of &quot;aliens&quot;?<br /><br />A: Eventually. But spooking the population is also seen as desirable.<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) They&#039;re trying to spook people.<br /><br />(PoB) It just about spooking or there are other influencing causes or reasons?<br /><br />(L) I think that the human-created drones are seen as being useful for spooking because they put &#039;em up there, they know what they are, they&#039;re in control of &#039;em, but they deny it. And of course that&#039;s like doing the whole COVID thing. People could see stuff in front of their eyes, and it was just being denied. What do they call it?<br /><br />(Andromeda) It&#039;s gaslighting.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, gaslighting.<br /><br />(Joe) So is it true to say that this was like a &quot;aliens&quot; plan to have these drones or craft fly around and then the military, the government, deep state, whatever, decided to put theirs up when they realized it was happening to muddy the waters? Is that a reasonable...?<br /><br />A: Close<br /><br />Q: (Joe) And with all the denials from the government saying there&#039;s nothing going on here, do they actually know fully what is going on?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) They know at least partially that it&#039;s...<br /><br />(L) They know what they&#039;re doing and they know that the aliens are doing something, but they don&#039;t really fully know what the aliens are doing.<br /><br />(Andromeda) What their plan is...<br /><br />(Joe) No, but the question is...<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) Have they tried to shoot one down?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) So people like the Pentagon spoke, at that level of government, ya know, overt government figures... Did they know of this alien presence?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Gaby) So why are the aliens doing it now?<br /><br />A: Part of ongoing plans falling into place. [ferocious dogs growl and bark during answer :)]<br /><br />Q: (L) And I guess we&#039;ve already been told what those plans are.<br /><br />(Joe) Well, are they? Do we? Have we?<br /><br />(L) We have been a number of times.<br /><br />(Joe) Long term or short term?<br /><br />(L) So, you say that they want to influence and read...<br /><br />(Andromeda) And that&#039;s part of a larger plan.<br /><br />(L) Influence and read...<br /><br />(seek10) Can we ask why New Jersey is the spot?<br /><br />A: Heavily programmed population there.<br /><br />Q: (L) Where is that place where they had all those weird experiments going on? Montauk! Where is Montauk in relation to New Jersey?<br /><br />(Joe) Isn&#039;t that New York?<br /><br />(Niall) Long Island, no?<br /><br />[Montauk is a hamlet located at the eastern tip of Long Island, New York]<br /><br />(L) Does Montauk have anything to do with any of this?<br /><br />A: Yes. It is all interrelated.<br /><br />Q: (L) So my guess is that they have people there that are programmed to do things and that they&#039;re interested in determining if they&#039;re ready to perform their programmed activities or if they need additional programming... Okay... Are they planning to turn people on or off in terms of programming?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Surely reading and influencing of members of the population could be done without such a visible display of lights in the sky and stuff. So it seems that the main agenda here is obviously to spook the population and prepare them, like I said, acclimatize them to lights in the sky, UFOs...<br /><br />A: Also, the invisibility granted by a firmly structured density veil is not as secure as previously.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Okay. So it&#039;s likely that a lot more of these things are going to be seen around the world.<br /><br />(L) So does that mean that when people have in the past or in other times and places been read and influenced and so forth - we kind of joke about it as being like the cryptogeographic being - that what&#039;s actually happening is some kind of orbs or something are nearby, only they are concealed from view because the veil is more secure. Is that it?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) So with the veil being less secure, or &quot;thinning&quot; as we call it, that means that a lot more of this type of activity is visually seen and probably will be seen elsewhere - as well as other things that ordinarily would be concealed by the veil. Is that true?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So this is setting up an explanation in advance for that phenomenon being more visible, that people will say, &quot;Oh, it&#039;s just like in New Jersey: It was drones.&quot; It&#039;s a pretty poor effort on the part of government to convince people these are just drones. I mean, I suppose it&#039;s the best they can do, but...<br /><br />(Chu) Well, they&#039;re also telling people, even if they do say they&#039;re aliens, they&#039;re saying, &quot;They&#039;re benevolent! See, they&#039;re not doing anything to you!&quot;<br /><br />(L) Yeah. And the other thing is they&#039;re also trying to really reinforce the idea that it is a totally physical phenomenon. Because I mean, really covering up the highly strange nature of these things is one of their main goals and tricks.<br /><br />(Joe) But surely the &quot;aliens&quot; have the ability to always make it appear as if it&#039;s a physical phenomenon?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (Joe) They don&#039;t always have the ability to appear as drones or lights in the sky?<br /><br />(L) Actually, if you think about it, all the UFO sightings that have been proven to be, or shown to be really legit have always had high strangeness associated with them.<br /><br />(Joe) But not the ones in New Jersey recently.<br /><br />(L) But we&#039;re talking about human-made drones.<br /><br />(Joe) I&#039;m talking about alien drones that are appearing as - generally speaking - as a drone, a drone type object. People are saying that doesn&#039;t look like a plane. It&#039;s too small, it&#039;s weird, et cetera, et cetera. So they&#039;re not able to make it look exactly like a drone. But they do seem to be able to manifest as something that people see as a physical object, albeit a bit strange looking.<br /><br />A: Some of those are human made decoys.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Right.<br /><br />(Chu) And then there&#039;s the weird orbs and stuff that don&#039;t look very human.<br /><br />(Joe) Well, there are a few, but the vast majority are ambiguous.<br /><br />(Andromeda) There&#039;s a mixed bag.<br /><br />(Niall) There&#039;s been a lot of videos of lights flashing on and off.<br /><br />(L) So somebody on the chat wants to know if the UFOs want to gauge how aware the population is getting? Um, do they want to...?<br /><br />A: Testing of the will, yes.<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) And also probably testing for the reaction to that kind of thing.<br /><br />(L) So what were you saying, Niall?<br /><br />(Niall) There are lots of videos people are posting. We don&#039;t know, but they claim to be associated with drones or in the areas where these drones are seen, where either street lights or car lights or building lights are not just flashing, they&#039;re blinking on and off.<br /><br />(Joe) And radio interference.<br /><br />(Niall) Is this associated with the sightings in the sky at all?<br /><br />(L) Your question is really loose. Is this associated with the drones? Or is it associated with the alien craft? I mean, make a distinction here. There&#039;s all kinds of shit going on in the sky.<br /><br />(Niall) I don&#039;t assume that it&#039;s associated with any of it. I don&#039;t know if it is. That&#039;s why I wanna go one first, then the next.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Could it be associated with the human decoy drones, the alien craft, or even part of this thinning of the veil? Weather phenomenon?<br /><br />(L) Yeah.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Is it associated with any of those?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) Which one?<br /><br />A: All sometimes.<br /><br />Q: (L) But we know from case histories that UFOs make cars stop, make things blink, etc. I mean, we&#039;ve seen that repeatedly in the case histories. We also know that overflying comet or meteorite fragments can cause all the car alarms in a neighborhood to go off, as well as all of the garage doors to open and close and so forth because there&#039;s electromagnetic anomalies. And we also know it can happen from weather. So, you&#039;d have to take a particular case in order to get an answer, a particular case and say, was this one due to whatever. Because if it&#039;s happening and the drones are there at the time, we may assume that it&#039;s associated.<br /><br />(Niall) Okay. Well, then let&#039;s assume, okay.<br /><br />(Joe) They said that it was part of an ongoing plan falling into place. Is that a long-term plan, or does this happening now in recent weeks have anything to do with... Is it related in any way to Trump becoming president and something that&#039;s planned for that? Or is it a longer term acclimatization only?<br /><br />A: As previously noted, there was a change in plans, thus some recalibration is needed.<br /><br />Q: (L) So... Okay, let me ask this: Is this activity beneficial to human beings?<br /><br />A: Decidedly not.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Why not?<br /><br />A: Review plans to amalgamate and rule humans after the changes.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) But that was going to happen... Okay, so it&#039;s just part of that longer term plan then.<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) And that was always going to happen, correct?<br /><br />(L) That&#039;s always been their plan, but...<br /><br />(Andromeda) Barring something that changed it, I suppose.<br /><br />(Joe) The C&#039;s have talked about that from day one.<br /><br />(Gaby) Does the current thinning of the veil that&#039;s going on now have anything to do with the 19-year lunar cycle in some sense?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (L) Can the 19-year lunar cycle be associated with a thinning of the veil?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) But not necessarily always. Can the 19-year lunar cycle be utilized in some way to open portals into our reality and that sort of thing?<br /><br />A: Yes indeed!<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) So what is the current thinning of the veil due to?<br /><br />A: Wave.<br /><br />Q: (Gaby) Well, I have a question about the lunar cycle. Is the next major lunar standstill on March 22, 2025 when we could potentially channel some positive energies through gravitational forces?<br /><br />A: Yes!<br /><br />Q: (L) So we should make a plan for the lunar standstill in March. Keep that in mind, everybody! Okay. Are we done with the drones?<br /><br />Q: (Chu) You want to see if any of the questions on the chat catch your attention here?<br /><br />(whitecoast) Does the thinning veil make it harder for 4D ships to maintain a &quot;fixed&quot; appearance matching the likeness of 3D craft?<br /><br />A: Can.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) What percentage, if we can get a percentage, roughly of the drones that have been cited were &quot;alien&quot; versus human?<br /><br />(L) What percentage of them were alien?<br /><br />A: 37<br /><br />Q: (L) 37 percent.<br /><br />(Joe) That means there were a majority of...<br /><br />(L) Distractions.<br /><br />(Joe) Well, 3D drones. Also, so in that context then, do humans, the government, deep state, whatever, do they have drone technology that is pretty far beyond what most of us here and the average person is aware of?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) Pretty fancy stuff. So is the government using their drones to send signals to people and...?<br /><br />A: Yes and those who have been vaccinated have transmitters and receivers.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So we&#039;re talking here maybe already or very quickly, we&#039;re getting to the point where so-called alien tech and human tech is merging or indistinguishable to some extent, or not indistinguishable, but difficult...<br /><br />(Andromeda) Difficult to distinguish from a distance.<br /><br />Q: (L) Would you say it&#039;s difficult to distinguish without careful analysis?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) So, what else?<br /><br />(Ant22) With Tucker Carlson talking about [the UFO phenomenon] being supernatural in interviews, I guess the material nature of the UFO phenomenon is something they&#039;d want to reinforce.<br /><br />(L) Is that why they&#039;re doing this?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) I&#039;m sure it&#039;s part. Let&#039;s see... Well, we kind of covered that:<br /><br />(Ivan) Are the battery malfunctions that people have reported real? If real, are they related to the aliens or the drones? I am asking because this type of thing has been reported by Simon Hein in his book and related to crop circles or near crop circles. Again, if real, what is it that causes a battery&#039;s charge to drop instantly?<br /><br />(L) We were kind of talking about that cars going off and on and we know about battery malfunctions occur with many UFO interactions. We just kind of covered that. What is it that causes a battery&#039;s charge to drop instantly? Now that&#039;s an interesting question.<br /><br />A: The energy is drawn off into 4D.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Is that a natural function?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) So when there&#039;s a breach in the veil, either naturally or when it&#039;s being blasted by, say, comet fragments or meteors, or when it&#039;s happening because UFOs are breaching it, it causes a loss of energy to 4D?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Is that a natural transference from 3D to 4D? Does that happen at any time there&#039;s a veil breach in that sense?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) But then that energy comes back into 3D from 4D, doesn&#039;t it?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) So there are ways that it comes in and then ways that it goes out. What are some of the ways that it comes in?<br /><br />A: Lightning, for example.<br /><br />Q: (L) All right. Next question:<br /><br />(Saman) Can we know a bit more in general layman terms how this stage of the Wave cycle is causing the thinning of the veil that normally hides hyperdimensional activity from 3D STS beings?<br /><br />A: There are no specific layman terms. But in general just think of 3D merging into 4D.<br /><br />(Joe) Can we, it&#039;s not on the drones, but it may be related to the thinning of the veil. We&#039;re just wondering about Leia who had an accident.<br /><br />(Andromeda) We assume a fall.<br /><br />(Joe) We assume she had a fall, but anyway, she broke two ribs a few days ago. Don&#039;t know how. Outside somewhere. It was anomalous. It was weird. Strange. Was that...<br /><br />(Chu) What happened to her?<br /><br />A: Encounter with energy anomaly.<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) Did this thing cause her to jump or fall or something like that?<br /><br />A: Pushed.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) What was the nature of the energy anomaly?<br /><br />A: Like an energy &quot;wind&quot;.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Is that related to thinning of the veil?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) And did something similar happen to Falcor that same evening?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Was it kind of like a wind that something he ran into or some kind of a...?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) It just hit him?<br /><br />(Joe) So he didn&#039;t see anything. The thing is, he ran off or something as if he was aware of something.<br /><br />A: Animals have a different perception of energy.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So it wasn&#039;t something that was particularly malevolent or benevolent?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (L) But, I mean, you can&#039;t say that a hurricane is malevolent or benevolent, but it...<br /><br />(Niall) Falcor started yelping like he was in pain.<br /><br />(Joe) Well, he ran into something. Something hit him.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Something hit him.<br /><br />(L) Yeah.<br /><br />(Joe) Like an energy wind.<br /><br />(L) Or a blockage or something like that.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Poor little puppies!<br /><br />(Joe) It was more or less outside your window.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, it was outside my office window. It was weird.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Is there anything we can do to protect the puppies against this kind of thing?<br /><br />A: Present times are very unstable for all beings. Awareness and vigilance protect.<br /><br />Q: (L) All right. I have to take a momentary break.<br /><br />[Laura leaves...]<br /><br />(Joe) Poor Leia!<br /><br />(Niall) She was pushed enough by something...<br /><br />(Joe) Deliberately.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Poor little honey... It didn&#039;t make sense that she would fall.<br /><br />(Niall) She must have been on the ledge.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Yeah, she must have been close enough, but I mean, it just doesn&#039;t make sense that she would fall. It&#039;s not slippery. She doesn&#039;t get way up close to the edge unless we&#039;re there.<br /><br />(Niall) An energy wind... Well, the follow-up question would be, are humans subjected to random energy winds as well?<br /><br />(Chu) Probably.<br /><br />(Joe) That&#039;s a good question. Why it would happen with the two dogs as opposed to...<br /><br />(Andromeda) ...to humans.<br /><br />(Niall) And why on the same day?<br /><br />(Andromeda) Right. Oh, we could ask about the starlings.<br /><br />(Ark) I wonder if we are in energy anomaly special zone. I remember these cars crashing nearby for no reason, you know? No one there and weren&#039;t there three? Three accidents.<br /><br />(Andromeda) I think they said it was because there was a bubble over us here.<br /><br />(Joe) A bubble of protection, yeah.<br /><br />(Jefferson) My son&#039;s car flew up in the wind two summers ago, And we asked the Cs.<br /><br />(Andromeda) That&#039;s right!<br /><br />(Jefferson) Yeah, the car flew up and then landed upside down.<br /><br />(Joe) Right.<br /><br />(Jefferson) Some energy difference.<br /><br />(Niall) So yeah, it obviously does hit people then.<br /><br />(Ark) But cars are not driven by animals.<br /><br />(Joe) No, not yet.<br /><br />(Niall) Except in Groundhog Day.<br /><br />(Chu) It could be different types of winds too. Some that affect animals, some that affect people.<br /><br />(Ark) Yeah.<br /><br />(Joe) When the wind is in the east. [Laughter; it&#039;s a reference to the BBC series, &quot;Bleak House&quot;]<br /><br />[Laura returns]<br /><br />(Andromeda) We&#039;ve got two more questions.<br /><br />(L) Oh, I thought of a question too.<br /><br />(Andromeda) You go first.<br /><br />(L) Can these energy winds be created or stimulated by other things such as...? I mean, in our reality, if a helicopter lands on your front lawn, there&#039;s a whole lot of wind. Is there something similar to that with these energy winds? Is it evidence of some other kind of hyperdimensional activity?<br /><br />(Andromeda) Like an effect of something else...<br /><br />(L) Yeah.<br /><br />A: Indeed and usually.<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) And can they affect humans? I mean, this was both of the doggies in one day.<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) Oh, and is there anything to the starlings that have been coming a lot more than usual and landing in our trees?<br /><br />(L) Is there anything, as in what?<br /><br />(Andromeda) As in any energetic related thing?<br /><br />A: Yes. Signs all over the earth.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Do the accidents or the events with the two dogs imply that there was some activity interested in this house here, or at that time?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) And what were they up to?<br /><br />A: Trying to read and influence.<br /><br />Q: (Niall) Was there one of those probes nearby?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Niall) Argh! I never saw it. Why didn&#039;t it show itself? Show your face!<br /><br />(Gaby) I saw, well, I thought I saw a red light, but I figured it was the Christmas lights.<br /><br />(L) So, does the protective bubble we have erected during some of our activities help protect us against things like that?<br /><br />A: For the most part, yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) So we need to shore up our defenses.<br /><br />A: Yes. And stay aware.<br /><br />Q: (L) Okay. All right. Are we done with that? Are we done with that, people?<br /><br />[Attendees on zoom nod]<br /><br />(seek10) One question, Laura: Can 3D drones disappear into thin air? I think that&#039;s part of a Philadelphia experiment.<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (L) I guess if they disappear into thin air, we know they&#039;re alien.<br /><br />(Farmies) Are frequency emitting health bands, such as Wave 1 and Nikki effective treatments against Lyme Disease as is claimed?<br /><br />A: Not likely.<br /><br />Q: (Farmies) Do they also work for other conditions they claim to help?<br /><br />A: Not strong enough to make a difference.<br /><br />(L) All right. Any other questions? Because I wanted this one to be a quick one tonight. We had to do this because of the drones.<br /><br />(Kinyash) Is there any chance that the current &quot;invasion&quot; can cause the deep state to prevent Trump from being inaugurated by instituting Continuity of Government?<br /><br />A: Possible but not likely.<br /><br />Q: (IrjO) Was the guy Luigi the real killer of the CEO of UnitedHealthCare?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (Niall) Wow! So the kid who is in prison now, and was just perp walked yesterday, was framed.<br /><br />(L) Is that it?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Niall) So, who killed him?<br /><br />A: Pro.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Working for Intel agencies?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So the head of the pharma company was taken out because...<br /><br />A: He knew too much and was high risk.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Was that related to vaccines?<br /><br />A: Corruption.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So, what are the chances that this Luigi guy will actually take the fall for it?<br /><br />(L) What do you mean? What&#039;s your question?<br /><br />(Joe) Will they be successful in prosecuting him and putting the blame on him?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Poor guy.<br /><br />(Andromeda and Gaby) Yeah.<br /><br />(Joe) Because he wasn&#039;t there, obviously.<br /><br />(Niall) He wasn&#039;t there. It was someone else. And people saw that! It was so obvious...<br /><br />A: Steamrolled.<br /><br />Q: (L) So, steamrolled instead of railroaded.<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Scottie) That&#039;s why there was... there was a picture going around on social media where he had peed his pants and somebody made a joke out of it and said, &quot;Oh, first you assassinated the CEO, and then you peed your pants!&quot; I&#039;m like, well, yeah, maybe that&#039;s because he didn&#039;t do it. I might have peed my pants too.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Yeah...<br /><br />(L) All right. Is there anything we need to know that we didn&#039;t ask?<br /><br />A: Stay alert. Things can get hectic! Goodbye.<br /><br />(Scottie) That&#039;s the understatement of the year!<br /><br />(L) Yeah, we know that! Well, well, well, drones, a complicated topic.

No reason not to.<br /><br />(L) I reckon!<br /><br />A: We are here, do not fear. Milonnioa of Cassiopaea.<br /><br />Q: (L) Whatever. All right. So I guess the big question on everybody&#039;s mind as NiallyBob just put it a minute ago, &quot;How about those drones?!&quot; I think we better break it down into a little bit better questions than that. Are the drones a strictly human-originated phenomenon?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (L) Are some of the drones, say, hyperdimensional for lack of a... hyperdimensional, alien, or whatever?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) Is there a visible difference between the human origin drones and the hyperdimensional drones?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) Why are they appearing in such great numbers and over such a wide area and apparently for a long time period? Yeah, so I&#039;m asking why?<br /><br />A: Many reasons depending on which time, place, and context. Closest description is human origin drones are meant to distract from &quot;alien&quot; drones and probes.<br /><br />Q: (L) What are the alien drones or probes up to?<br /><br />A: Psychic reading and influencing of selected populations.<br /><br />Q: (L) Is there any significance to the fact that this has happened kind of repeatedly over a period of at least five years at approximately the same time of the year?<br /><br />(Andromeda) Well, from what I understand, the last three years have been at the same time of year.<br /><br />(L) Last three years.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Right. And then before that there was one in July or something.<br /><br />(Joe) Here&#039;s the thing: A year ago, almost a year ago, and the year before, there were drones sighted over Langley Air Force Base. Last year for 17 days.<br /><br />(Chu) There was one in December-January, 2019 according to Approaching Infinity.<br /><br />(Joe) Yeah, I mean, you can go back quite a long time for sightings over military bases. You can go back to the sixties if you want. So the question is whether or not the sightings, for example one year ago over Langley Air Force Base, have anything to do with what&#039;s happening today? Or is that a separate...?<br /><br />(L) So are they all related in some way?<br /><br />A: Similar.<br /><br />Q: (L) So they&#039;re there for reading and influencing of selected populations?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Over a military base.<br /><br />(Niall) Specifically military populations?<br /><br />(Joe) Only a military base.<br /><br />(L) Is it specifically military or, okay... Is it only military?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) They were also spotted over two US military bases in the UK, and one in Germany, both this year in November.<br /><br />(Chu) And if you count the orbs, then it&#039;s more widespread.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Well, were those the same kind of thing in the UK and in Germany?<br /><br />A: Close<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So maybe a question is: Given that drones have been sighted over various military bases - and drones as in UFOs, they may be drones, maybe UFOs - over military bases going back many years up until last year. What is the significance of such a widespread phenomenon over the past month?<br /><br />A: Acclimatising the public.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) That&#039;s what I thought. So that was the specific agenda in it being such a widespread phenomenon.<br /><br />(L) Okay, do they also... I mean, I understand that probably a lot of them are... Maybe the reason they&#039;re so plentiful at this point in time is because gradually human beings have built up their stockpile of such drones so they can send them up to confuse things even better than they could before. Is that part of it?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So this would be acclimatizing the public to an eventual disclosure of &quot;aliens&quot;?<br /><br />A: Eventually. But spooking the population is also seen as desirable.<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) They&#039;re trying to spook people.<br /><br />(PoB) It just about spooking or there are other influencing causes or reasons?<br /><br />(L) I think that the human-created drones are seen as being useful for spooking because they put &#039;em up there, they know what they are, they&#039;re in control of &#039;em, but they deny it. And of course that&#039;s like doing the whole COVID thing. People could see stuff in front of their eyes, and it was just being denied. What do they call it?<br /><br />(Andromeda) It&#039;s gaslighting.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, gaslighting.<br /><br />(Joe) So is it true to say that this was like a &quot;aliens&quot; plan to have these drones or craft fly around and then the military, the government, deep state, whatever, decided to put theirs up when they realized it was happening to muddy the waters? Is that a reasonable...?<br /><br />A: Close<br /><br />Q: (Joe) And with all the denials from the government saying there&#039;s nothing going on here, do they actually know fully what is going on?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) They know at least partially that it&#039;s...<br /><br />(L) They know what they&#039;re doing and they know that the aliens are doing something, but they don&#039;t really fully know what the aliens are doing.<br /><br />(Andromeda) What their plan is...<br /><br />(Joe) No, but the question is...<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) Have they tried to shoot one down?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) So people like the Pentagon spoke, at that level of government, ya know, overt government figures... Did they know of this alien presence?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Gaby) So why are the aliens doing it now?<br /><br />A: Part of ongoing plans falling into place. [ferocious dogs growl and bark during answer :)]<br /><br />Q: (L) And I guess we&#039;ve already been told what those plans are.<br /><br />(Joe) Well, are they? Do we? Have we?<br /><br />(L) We have been a number of times.<br /><br />(Joe) Long term or short term?<br /><br />(L) So, you say that they want to influence and read...<br /><br />(Andromeda) And that&#039;s part of a larger plan.<br /><br />(L) Influence and read...<br /><br />(seek10) Can we ask why New Jersey is the spot?<br /><br />A: Heavily programmed population there.<br /><br />Q: (L) Where is that place where they had all those weird experiments going on? Montauk! Where is Montauk in relation to New Jersey?<br /><br />(Joe) Isn&#039;t that New York?<br /><br />(Niall) Long Island, no?<br /><br />[Montauk is a hamlet located at the eastern tip of Long Island, New York]<br /><br />(L) Does Montauk have anything to do with any of this?<br /><br />A: Yes. It is all interrelated.<br /><br />Q: (L) So my guess is that they have people there that are programmed to do things and that they&#039;re interested in determining if they&#039;re ready to perform their programmed activities or if they need additional programming... Okay... Are they planning to turn people on or off in terms of programming?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Surely reading and influencing of members of the population could be done without such a visible display of lights in the sky and stuff. So it seems that the main agenda here is obviously to spook the population and prepare them, like I said, acclimatize them to lights in the sky, UFOs...<br /><br />A: Also, the invisibility granted by a firmly structured density veil is not as secure as previously.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Okay. So it&#039;s likely that a lot more of these things are going to be seen around the world.<br /><br />(L) So does that mean that when people have in the past or in other times and places been read and influenced and so forth - we kind of joke about it as being like the cryptogeographic being - that what&#039;s actually happening is some kind of orbs or something are nearby, only they are concealed from view because the veil is more secure. Is that it?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) So with the veil being less secure, or &quot;thinning&quot; as we call it, that means that a lot more of this type of activity is visually seen and probably will be seen elsewhere - as well as other things that ordinarily would be concealed by the veil. Is that true?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So this is setting up an explanation in advance for that phenomenon being more visible, that people will say, &quot;Oh, it&#039;s just like in New Jersey: It was drones.&quot; It&#039;s a pretty poor effort on the part of government to convince people these are just drones. I mean, I suppose it&#039;s the best they can do, but...<br /><br />(Chu) Well, they&#039;re also telling people, even if they do say they&#039;re aliens, they&#039;re saying, &quot;They&#039;re benevolent! See, they&#039;re not doing anything to you!&quot;<br /><br />(L) Yeah. And the other thing is they&#039;re also trying to really reinforce the idea that it is a totally physical phenomenon. Because I mean, really covering up the highly strange nature of these things is one of their main goals and tricks.<br /><br />(Joe) But surely the &quot;aliens&quot; have the ability to always make it appear as if it&#039;s a physical phenomenon?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (Joe) They don&#039;t always have the ability to appear as drones or lights in the sky?<br /><br />(L) Actually, if you think about it, all the UFO sightings that have been proven to be, or shown to be really legit have always had high strangeness associated with them.<br /><br />(Joe) But not the ones in New Jersey recently.<br /><br />(L) But we&#039;re talking about human-made drones.<br /><br />(Joe) I&#039;m talking about alien drones that are appearing as - generally speaking - as a drone, a drone type object. People are saying that doesn&#039;t look like a plane. It&#039;s too small, it&#039;s weird, et cetera, et cetera. So they&#039;re not able to make it look exactly like a drone. But they do seem to be able to manifest as something that people see as a physical object, albeit a bit strange looking.<br /><br />A: Some of those are human made decoys.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Right.<br /><br />(Chu) And then there&#039;s the weird orbs and stuff that don&#039;t look very human.<br /><br />(Joe) Well, there are a few, but the vast majority are ambiguous.<br /><br />(Andromeda) There&#039;s a mixed bag.<br /><br />(Niall) There&#039;s been a lot of videos of lights flashing on and off.<br /><br />(L) So somebody on the chat wants to know if the UFOs want to gauge how aware the population is getting? Um, do they want to...?<br /><br />A: Testing of the will, yes.<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) And also probably testing for the reaction to that kind of thing.<br /><br />(L) So what were you saying, Niall?<br /><br />(Niall) There are lots of videos people are posting. We don&#039;t know, but they claim to be associated with drones or in the areas where these drones are seen, where either street lights or car lights or building lights are not just flashing, they&#039;re blinking on and off.<br /><br />(Joe) And radio interference.<br /><br />(Niall) Is this associated with the sightings in the sky at all?<br /><br />(L) Your question is really loose. Is this associated with the drones? Or is it associated with the alien craft? I mean, make a distinction here. There&#039;s all kinds of shit going on in the sky.<br /><br />(Niall) I don&#039;t assume that it&#039;s associated with any of it. I don&#039;t know if it is. That&#039;s why I wanna go one first, then the next.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Could it be associated with the human decoy drones, the alien craft, or even part of this thinning of the veil? Weather phenomenon?<br /><br />(L) Yeah.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Is it associated with any of those?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) Which one?<br /><br />A: All sometimes.<br /><br />Q: (L) But we know from case histories that UFOs make cars stop, make things blink, etc. I mean, we&#039;ve seen that repeatedly in the case histories. We also know that overflying comet or meteorite fragments can cause all the car alarms in a neighborhood to go off, as well as all of the garage doors to open and close and so forth because there&#039;s electromagnetic anomalies. And we also know it can happen from weather. So, you&#039;d have to take a particular case in order to get an answer, a particular case and say, was this one due to whatever. Because if it&#039;s happening and the drones are there at the time, we may assume that it&#039;s associated.<br /><br />(Niall) Okay. Well, then let&#039;s assume, okay.<br /><br />(Joe) They said that it was part of an ongoing plan falling into place. Is that a long-term plan, or does this happening now in recent weeks have anything to do with... Is it related in any way to Trump becoming president and something that&#039;s planned for that? Or is it a longer term acclimatization only?<br /><br />A: As previously noted, there was a change in plans, thus some recalibration is needed.<br /><br />Q: (L) So... Okay, let me ask this: Is this activity beneficial to human beings?<br /><br />A: Decidedly not.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Why not?<br /><br />A: Review plans to amalgamate and rule humans after the changes.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) But that was going to happen... Okay, so it&#039;s just part of that longer term plan then.<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) And that was always going to happen, correct?<br /><br />(L) That&#039;s always been their plan, but...<br /><br />(Andromeda) Barring something that changed it, I suppose.<br /><br />(Joe) The C&#039;s have talked about that from day one.<br /><br />(Gaby) Does the current thinning of the veil that&#039;s going on now have anything to do with the 19-year lunar cycle in some sense?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (L) Can the 19-year lunar cycle be associated with a thinning of the veil?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) But not necessarily always. Can the 19-year lunar cycle be utilized in some way to open portals into our reality and that sort of thing?<br /><br />A: Yes indeed!<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) So what is the current thinning of the veil due to?<br /><br />A: Wave.<br /><br />Q: (Gaby) Well, I have a question about the lunar cycle. Is the next major lunar standstill on March 22, 2025 when we could potentially channel some positive energies through gravitational forces?<br /><br />A: Yes!<br /><br />Q: (L) So we should make a plan for the lunar standstill in March. Keep that in mind, everybody! Okay. Are we done with the drones?<br /><br />Q: (Chu) You want to see if any of the questions on the chat catch your attention here?<br /><br />(whitecoast) Does the thinning veil make it harder for 4D ships to maintain a &quot;fixed&quot; appearance matching the likeness of 3D craft?<br /><br />A: Can.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) What percentage, if we can get a percentage, roughly of the drones that have been cited were &quot;alien&quot; versus human?<br /><br />(L) What percentage of them were alien?<br /><br />A: 37<br /><br />Q: (L) 37 percent.<br /><br />(Joe) That means there were a majority of...<br /><br />(L) Distractions.<br /><br />(Joe) Well, 3D drones. Also, so in that context then, do humans, the government, deep state, whatever, do they have drone technology that is pretty far beyond what most of us here and the average person is aware of?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) Pretty fancy stuff. So is the government using their drones to send signals to people and...?<br /><br />A: Yes and those who have been vaccinated have transmitters and receivers.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So we&#039;re talking here maybe already or very quickly, we&#039;re getting to the point where so-called alien tech and human tech is merging or indistinguishable to some extent, or not indistinguishable, but difficult...<br /><br />(Andromeda) Difficult to distinguish from a distance.<br /><br />Q: (L) Would you say it&#039;s difficult to distinguish without careful analysis?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) So, what else?<br /><br />(Ant22) With Tucker Carlson talking about [the UFO phenomenon] being supernatural in interviews, I guess the material nature of the UFO phenomenon is something they&#039;d want to reinforce.<br /><br />(L) Is that why they&#039;re doing this?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) I&#039;m sure it&#039;s part. Let&#039;s see... Well, we kind of covered that:<br /><br />(Ivan) Are the battery malfunctions that people have reported real? If real, are they related to the aliens or the drones? I am asking because this type of thing has been reported by Simon Hein in his book and related to crop circles or near crop circles. Again, if real, what is it that causes a battery&#039;s charge to drop instantly?<br /><br />(L) We were kind of talking about that cars going off and on and we know about battery malfunctions occur with many UFO interactions. We just kind of covered that. What is it that causes a battery&#039;s charge to drop instantly? Now that&#039;s an interesting question.<br /><br />A: The energy is drawn off into 4D.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Is that a natural function?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) So when there&#039;s a breach in the veil, either naturally or when it&#039;s being blasted by, say, comet fragments or meteors, or when it&#039;s happening because UFOs are breaching it, it causes a loss of energy to 4D?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Is that a natural transference from 3D to 4D? Does that happen at any time there&#039;s a veil breach in that sense?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) But then that energy comes back into 3D from 4D, doesn&#039;t it?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) So there are ways that it comes in and then ways that it goes out. What are some of the ways that it comes in?<br /><br />A: Lightning, for example.<br /><br />Q: (L) All right. Next question:<br /><br />(Saman) Can we know a bit more in general layman terms how this stage of the Wave cycle is causing the thinning of the veil that normally hides hyperdimensional activity from 3D STS beings?<br /><br />A: There are no specific layman terms. But in general just think of 3D merging into 4D.<br /><br />(Joe) Can we, it&#039;s not on the drones, but it may be related to the thinning of the veil. We&#039;re just wondering about Leia who had an accident.<br /><br />(Andromeda) We assume a fall.<br /><br />(Joe) We assume she had a fall, but anyway, she broke two ribs a few days ago. Don&#039;t know how. Outside somewhere. It was anomalous. It was weird. Strange. Was that...<br /><br />(Chu) What happened to her?<br /><br />A: Encounter with energy anomaly.<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) Did this thing cause her to jump or fall or something like that?<br /><br />A: Pushed.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) What was the nature of the energy anomaly?<br /><br />A: Like an energy &quot;wind&quot;.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Is that related to thinning of the veil?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) And did something similar happen to Falcor that same evening?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Was it kind of like a wind that something he ran into or some kind of a...?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) It just hit him?<br /><br />(Joe) So he didn&#039;t see anything. The thing is, he ran off or something as if he was aware of something.<br /><br />A: Animals have a different perception of energy.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So it wasn&#039;t something that was particularly malevolent or benevolent?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (L) But, I mean, you can&#039;t say that a hurricane is malevolent or benevolent, but it...<br /><br />(Niall) Falcor started yelping like he was in pain.<br /><br />(Joe) Well, he ran into something. Something hit him.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Something hit him.<br /><br />(L) Yeah.<br /><br />(Joe) Like an energy wind.<br /><br />(L) Or a blockage or something like that.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Poor little puppies!<br /><br />(Joe) It was more or less outside your window.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, it was outside my office window. It was weird.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Is there anything we can do to protect the puppies against this kind of thing?<br /><br />A: Present times are very unstable for all beings. Awareness and vigilance protect.<br /><br />Q: (L) All right. I have to take a momentary break.<br /><br />[Laura leaves...]<br /><br />(Joe) Poor Leia!<br /><br />(Niall) She was pushed enough by something...<br /><br />(Joe) Deliberately.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Poor little honey... It didn&#039;t make sense that she would fall.<br /><br />(Niall) She must have been on the ledge.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Yeah, she must have been close enough, but I mean, it just doesn&#039;t make sense that she would fall. It&#039;s not slippery. She doesn&#039;t get way up close to the edge unless we&#039;re there.<br /><br />(Niall) An energy wind... Well, the follow-up question would be, are humans subjected to random energy winds as well?<br /><br />(Chu) Probably.<br /><br />(Joe) That&#039;s a good question. Why it would happen with the two dogs as opposed to...<br /><br />(Andromeda) ...to humans.<br /><br />(Niall) And why on the same day?<br /><br />(Andromeda) Right. Oh, we could ask about the starlings.<br /><br />(Ark) I wonder if we are in energy anomaly special zone. I remember these cars crashing nearby for no reason, you know? No one there and weren&#039;t there three? Three accidents.<br /><br />(Andromeda) I think they said it was because there was a bubble over us here.<br /><br />(Joe) A bubble of protection, yeah.<br /><br />(Jefferson) My son&#039;s car flew up in the wind two summers ago, And we asked the Cs.<br /><br />(Andromeda) That&#039;s right!<br /><br />(Jefferson) Yeah, the car flew up and then landed upside down.<br /><br />(Joe) Right.<br /><br />(Jefferson) Some energy difference.<br /><br />(Niall) So yeah, it obviously does hit people then.<br /><br />(Ark) But cars are not driven by animals.<br /><br />(Joe) No, not yet.<br /><br />(Niall) Except in Groundhog Day.<br /><br />(Chu) It could be different types of winds too. Some that affect animals, some that affect people.<br /><br />(Ark) Yeah.<br /><br />(Joe) When the wind is in the east. [Laughter; it&#039;s a reference to the BBC series, &quot;Bleak House&quot;]<br /><br />[Laura returns]<br /><br />(Andromeda) We&#039;ve got two more questions.<br /><br />(L) Oh, I thought of a question too.<br /><br />(Andromeda) You go first.<br /><br />(L) Can these energy winds be created or stimulated by other things such as...? I mean, in our reality, if a helicopter lands on your front lawn, there&#039;s a whole lot of wind. Is there something similar to that with these energy winds? Is it evidence of some other kind of hyperdimensional activity?<br /><br />(Andromeda) Like an effect of something else...<br /><br />(L) Yeah.<br /><br />A: Indeed and usually.<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) And can they affect humans? I mean, this was both of the doggies in one day.<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) Oh, and is there anything to the starlings that have been coming a lot more than usual and landing in our trees?<br /><br />(L) Is there anything, as in what?<br /><br />(Andromeda) As in any energetic related thing?<br /><br />A: Yes. Signs all over the earth.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Do the accidents or the events with the two dogs imply that there was some activity interested in this house here, or at that time?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) And what were they up to?<br /><br />A: Trying to read and influence.<br /><br />Q: (Niall) Was there one of those probes nearby?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Niall) Argh! I never saw it. Why didn&#039;t it show itself? Show your face!<br /><br />(Gaby) I saw, well, I thought I saw a red light, but I figured it was the Christmas lights.<br /><br />(L) So, does the protective bubble we have erected during some of our activities help protect us against things like that?<br /><br />A: For the most part, yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) So we need to shore up our defenses.<br /><br />A: Yes. And stay aware.<br /><br />Q: (L) Okay. All right. Are we done with that? Are we done with that, people?<br /><br />[Attendees on zoom nod]<br /><br />(seek10) One question, Laura: Can 3D drones disappear into thin air? I think that&#039;s part of a Philadelphia experiment.<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (L) I guess if they disappear into thin air, we know they&#039;re alien.<br /><br />(Farmies) Are frequency emitting health bands, such as Wave 1 and Nikki effective treatments against Lyme Disease as is claimed?<br /><br />A: Not likely.<br /><br />Q: (Farmies) Do they also work for other conditions they claim to help?<br /><br />A: Not strong enough to make a difference.<br /><br />(L) All right. Any other questions? Because I wanted this one to be a quick one tonight. We had to do this because of the drones.<br /><br />(Kinyash) Is there any chance that the current &quot;invasion&quot; can cause the deep state to prevent Trump from being inaugurated by instituting Continuity of Government?<br /><br />A: Possible but not likely.<br /><br />Q: (IrjO) Was the guy Luigi the real killer of the CEO of UnitedHealthCare?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (Niall) Wow! So the kid who is in prison now, and was just perp walked yesterday, was framed.<br /><br />(L) Is that it?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Niall) So, who killed him?<br /><br />A: Pro.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Working for Intel agencies?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So the head of the pharma company was taken out because...<br /><br />A: He knew too much and was high risk.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Was that related to vaccines?<br /><br />A: Corruption.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So, what are the chances that this Luigi guy will actually take the fall for it?<br /><br />(L) What do you mean? What&#039;s your question?<br /><br />(Joe) Will they be successful in prosecuting him and putting the blame on him?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Poor guy.<br /><br />(Andromeda and Gaby) Yeah.<br /><br />(Joe) Because he wasn&#039;t there, obviously.<br /><br />(Niall) He wasn&#039;t there. It was someone else. And people saw that! It was so obvious...<br /><br />A: Steamrolled.<br /><br />Q: (L) So, steamrolled instead of railroaded.<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Scottie) That&#039;s why there was... there was a picture going around on social media where he had peed his pants and somebody made a joke out of it and said, &quot;Oh, first you assassinated the CEO, and then you peed your pants!&quot; I&#039;m like, well, yeah, maybe that&#039;s because he didn&#039;t do it. I might have peed my pants too.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Yeah...<br /><br />(L) All right. Is there anything we need to know that we didn&#039;t ask?<br /><br />A: Stay alert. Things can get hectic! Goodbye.<br /><br />(Scottie) That&#039;s the understatement of the year!<br /><br />(L) Yeah, we know that! Well, well, well, drones, a complicated topic. Poor Luigi.<br /><br />END OF SESSION</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>&quot;(seek10) Can we ask why New Jersey is the spot?<br /><br />A: Heavily programmed population there.&quot;<br /><br />For what it is worth - I researched lightly, the area of the United States reaction to the Radio Broadcast of H.G. Wells&#039; <i>&quot;War of the Worlds&quot;</i> .   Ground zero for the storyline was the fictional town of Grovers Mill, New Jersey.   So the human reaction of fear and panic happened in New Jersey (which is a frightfully small state - 8,279 sq miles or 13323.759 sq kilometers) and in New York City and Long Island, which geographically are linearly next to each other AND Montauk is on the far Eastern part of that line.  October 30, 1938 was the broadcast date.   So basically the C&#039;s saying that this area is &quot;Heavily programmed&quot; and probably have been for a long time.  I lived in Jersey City for 10 years and indeed, the population is very weird and I had to move back to the Upper Central USA.<br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 19101\" data-quote=\"EmeraldR\" data-source=\"post: 1224192\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1224192\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1224192\">EmeraldR said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \"><img src=\"/forum/styles/cass/smilies/wizard.gif\"  class=\"smilie\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\":wizard:\" title=\"Wizard    :wizard:\" data-shortname=\":wizard:\" /> Thanks so very much Laura,Andromeda ,all the Chateau Crew and of course Milonnioa of Cassiopaea<br /><br />(L) So, does the protective bubble we have erected during some of our activities help protect us against things like that?<br /><br />A: For the most part, yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) So we need to shore up our defenses.<br /><br />A: Yes.

And Start Speaking Up, Saying No, Asking Boldly, And Unapologetically Being Yourself :</i><br /><br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"\" data-quote=\"\" data-source=\"\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \"><b>Energy Bubble</b><br /><br />This is a simple and effective visualization that can help your subconscious mind let go of taking on so much responsibility for other people’s feelings.You can do this first thing when you wake up in the morning, or as you remember throughout the day.<br /><br />Imagine a clear bubble all around your body. It surrounds you completely and is about two or three feet away from your skin on all sides. It goes out in front, behind you, to the sides, above your head, and even several feet down into the ground beneath you. It can be completely clear or it can have a slight color to it, whichever color you like: green, blue, pink, red, yellow, or anything that feels right. Mine is typically light green.<br /><br />Take a moment to look around you, imagining this bubble. Seeing it on all sides, becoming more aware of its presence. This is your energy bubble. It stands between you and other people as a semi-permeable membrane. That means it lets in certain things while keeping others out. Other people’s anger, anxiety, judgments and criticisms remain outside the bubble. Love, excitement, and positive connection can pass right through so you can feel it deeply.<br /><br />This may seem strange to you, or too simple to be of any real impact. But it can be quite powerful. <b>Imagery and symbols communicate directly with our emotional brain in a way that words and language do not. This is one of the reasons why our dreams, which are made up almost entirely of imagery and symbols, are often so dominated by feelings.</b><br /><br />I first began using this technique when I was doing face-to-face counseling as a psychotherapist. I noticed that after certain sessions I would be affected by what my client had shared, emotionally wrapped up in the drama of their lives, as if I were the one who was fighting with my partner, breaking up, anxious, or depressed. I wanted to be supportive, yet I needed to take care of myself in order to do effective work and thrive in my own life.<br /><br />Each morning before I began my sessions, I would take several minutes to imagine this bubble. I gave mine a bright, transparent green color that I could see through. <b>I would remind myself that it kept everything out that wasn’t mine, and that taking on other people’s struggles was very different than helping them through theirs.</b><br /><br />During sessions, when there was a particularly intense moment or story that a client was sharing with me, I would remind myself of the bubble and let myself imagine it there again in the session. Sometimes, I would imagine clear water cascading down on the outside of the bubble, gently washing the outside and adding another boundary to keep me completely safe.<br /><br />If I felt myself taking in too much of any emotion that I didn’t need, I would imagine myself gently moving it back outside the bubble with my next exhale, saying in my mind, this is not mine, thank you.<br /><br />Using this technique doesn’t eliminate compassion or empathy for the people around us. We can still be strongly moved by the joys and sorrows of the people in our lives. It just helps distinguish between being moved by another’s suffering, and taking that suffering on as your own. Seeing the pain and desiring to help alleviate it is compassion. Feeling the pain and becoming angry, sad, anxious, or upset yourself is a sign of taking on something that is not yours.<br /><br /><b>You can experiment with this technique to emotionally release feeling overly responsible for others’ experiences.</b> For example, one of my clients, Olivia, imagined this bubble around herself whenever her mother was angry. Her mother would storm around the kitchen, silently oozing anger and resentment in a way that was hard to ignore. She would occasionally say something to my client in an impatient or harsh tone.<br /><br />Olivia felt responsible for her mother’s anger, even though she intellectually knew that it had nothing to do with her. Regardless, she would instantly react with strong feelings of anxiety, unease, and an impulse to door say something that would fix it instantly (or just run away).<br /><br />As she imagined this bubble, she became more able to simply be in the presence of her mother, doing what she needed to do in the kitchen, while feeling more space between them. During one session, she told me that while she was in the kitchen with this energy bubble around her she had this insight, which helped her feel calmer around her mother, even when she was angry: There’s something going on with her, and those are her feelings to deal with, not mine.<br /><br />Is this energy bubble going to solve all of your problems and bring you instant joy, peace, and happiness forever and ever? Yes. And for the low price of $9,999.99 you can get your very own bubble now!<br /><br /><b>No, this bubble is not a cure all.

Fortunately, lies are some and not all of the things that can be seen or heard in this world.<br />Also, if our FAITH IS TRUE, the advice to not focus too much on the problem (lie in this case), and focus more on the solution (truth in this case) makes a lot of sense.<br />I think it is very important to keep that in mind at this time, because the transition is a process and, we can neither assure nor rule out that we are living the first stages.<br /><br />Whatever the transition process is, let&#039;s not forget that in 4D thoughts can be more fluidly concretized and/or visible.<br />Hence the importance of focusing less on the problem and more on the solution. <br />If this applies and is advisable for life in 3D, imagine then the relevance it can have in 4D.<br /><br />This has many implications, but now I am just trying to point out one with all this.<br />Perhaps I can better explain with a practical example what I mean:<br /><br />Suppose we are faced with a lie. Something that according to the knowledge we have, we can objectively see it as the lie that it is. OK?<br />Good. Now, let&#039;s put our potential into practice, to see to it that that lie stays where it is, that is, on a ground of observation or our ground of observation, so to speak.<br />The idea is not to allow that lie to pass into the creative terrain that we all have.<br /><br />Our creative part should concentrate above all on the specific Truths that make that lie a lie, and not on the lie itself, since the lie in particular we have already studied, analyzed and understood in the field of observation, or contemplation is perhaps a correct term as well.  <br /><br />The practical result of this conscious activity is that we would be transmitting, reflecting or projecting truths to the environment, without increasing the prominence of the lie in question, or that it makes more noise than it was already doing in that environment.<br />The mere fact of bringing factual information into the environment makes a difference.<br />It increases the likelihood that people in that environment will detect lies and see them for the lies they are.<br /><br />This is no different than what we&#039;ve already been doing as best we can. I&#039;m just trying to imagine how it works or what the dynamics of functioning on the “planes of thought” would be like.<br /><br />In short, I&#039;m thinking about the mental discipline that was always important to have, but more importantly how relevant and determining mental discipline can become, during the reality change process, and in the new reality as well.<br /><br />Anyway, we have a lot to learn by working on a daily basis.<br />The above were just some thoughts.<br />Don&#039;t think I ramble all day long like I do now.

I will not talk about other regions of the world where similar crises are taking place, based basically on the same basis, because I do not know to what extent this concerns ufo activity. and it seems to me that in addition to globalization, conscious actions of hidden political, ideological and economic spheres, the whole thing can simply be intensified, accelerated and simplified by ufos. so that what normally would happen in 100 years happens in 100 years. we could always assume that we invented computers, the internet, that apart from radio and television, it influenced globalization, just like global travel, that mass food led to certain defects in generally available nutrition, that the actions of services and chance, or simple human greed and oversights created such and such vaccines... generally speaking, that it is the effect of human activity and natural changes, only that the presence of ufos is a fact. are they pacifists, demonstrating superiority, or is it simply a side effect, e.g. by disconnecting nuclear silos? I rather think that it would be about the psychological influence on people - superficial, and probably this is how a more profound effect manifests itself<br />in this sense, sto (also as the land of our origin) is some objective, helpful factor helping us find our way in this chaos. or, as they said, &quot;we can always return home&quot;, because regardless of the situation, omnipresent manipulation, allusions, etc., this factor is present.

We would have free, clean energy.  We would not have vast numbers of human beings living in poverty or starving.  We would have no over-population problems.  Health issues that dominate Western society and are bringing it to its knees would not be a problem because there would be plenty of nourishing food for all.  There would be no wars because scientific anthropology and social psychology would have figured out what is the best of all possible forms of social structure that allows for the widest expression of human types to flourish in harmony.  Children would not be medicated at ever younger ages because cognitive science would have established the best way to rear and educate them, and couples would be able to attend classes on infant care and parenting that were actually effective.  The best forms of education would be known so that the widest variety of options would be available to the varied human types and levels of intelligence and skill so that each individual would progress into a life of satisfaction doing what they really enjoy and are best at doing, and society would benefit by not wasting its most precious resource: human beings.  Consciousness – and non-material spirit – would be understood and the proper reverence for Nature and the Cosmos would be a natural part of the lives of all, and the well-known religious feelings in human beings would be directed toward compassion and empathy, not used by manipulative leaders to incite anger, aggression and death.  Free will, rather than being outright denied in science and philosophy as well as in very real terms politically, would be respected as the sacred principle that it is. In short, humankind would know how to live in harmony not only with each other, but with the world in which they are born.</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":20224,"user":"benklerk","id":1225193,"date":"2025-01-03T09:02:22+0100","text":"I haven&#039;t read all the comments.

That often means intentional suffering. These choices to suffer on behalf of ourselves (an also on behalf of a better future for all) are made by developing our spiritual perception. This Seeing allows us to read the clues in our environment, as well as in our own thinking, feeling, and way of Being. We learn to read dangers and opportunities. As such, growing in Knowledge and keeping in a constant state of awareness are paramount - as well as the courage to make difficult choices. All this opens up the conduit for our higher selves to come through.<br /><br />So yeah, my thinking these days is that the most empowering way of interpreting the C&#039;s frequent saying that &#039;help is on the way&#039; is the WE are the help - we can learn help ourselves, and of course, help each other through the network.","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":30,"user":"Joe","id":1225236,"date":"2025-01-03T17:27:16+0100","text":"<blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 20224\" data-quote=\"benklerk\" data-source=\"post: 1225193\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1225193\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1225193\">benklerk said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">If we are heading towards main stream alien discloser, having all the drones in the sky is one way to go about it, but it needs to start showing above more cities around the world, before more and more people start to ask the bigger questions.

Think of the incidents that have occurred during the last few days - the vehicles being driven into holiday celebrants at Christmas markets and such, an illegal immigrant purposely setting a woman on fire on the subway - these the most egregious to come to mind.

The general public doesn&#039;t seem to have this same understanding, though, and probably <i>are</i> being fooled that all the mysterious drones are just government physical aerial vehicles - nothing alien whatsoever . . . maybe. The vax ensuring that the majority believe the false scenario along with the usual mass media/political tactics. Can we counter this false belief via X/twitter and Sott? At least try. Laura has certainly put forth an alternate assessment of what&#039;s happening along with promotion of <i>High Strangeness</i>.

Many movie reviewers therefore saw the movie as a subtle nod to the stealthy take over of America by communist operatives and agents as was being advocated by Senator Joe McCarthy. <br /><br />I think the main difference in the storyline between the pod people of<i> The</i> <i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i> and <i>Star Trek&#039;s </i>the Borg is that the pod people were complete replacements or facsimiles of the original humans (minus their emotions and human sensibilities) whose bodies had been destroyed, whereas the Borg drones are still the original bodies and brains of the humanoids who have been assimilated into the Borg collective save that they have been completely taken over in mind and body (which is usually augmented by Borg technology) and have lost all individuality. Hence, your fate as a Borg drone is to end up a soulless automaton serving the collective with no free will of your own. <br /><br />For those of you who are Sci-Fi fans, the Borg are in many ways comparable to <i>Dr Who</i>&#039;s the Cybermen who are cyber-genetic beings from another planet who had once been human but through increased reliance on cyber augmentation had eventually lost their humanity along the way. The Cybermen were created in the late 1960&#039;s by the writers <b>Henry Lincoln</b> (yes he of <i>The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail</i> fame) and<b> Kit Pedler</b>, the latter being a real scientist who wished to express the idea of cyber technology eventually transforming human beings into emotionless automatons devoid of all that makes a person a souled individual. He was thus taking the current transhumanist agenda to its logical conclusion even before that movement had really got going. <br /><br />In many ways the cybermen can be seen as comparable to the alien Greys who the C&#039;s tell us are 4D cyber-genetic beings with no individual souls of their own:<br />&#8203;</div><i><span style=\"color: rgb(41, 105, 176)\">Q: (L) Are the little gray beings from Zeta Reticuli also?</span></i><br /><span style=\"color: rgb(41, 105, 176)\"><i><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) Are the little gray beings...<br /><br />A: <b>Cybergenetic</b>. <br /><br />Q: (L) Are they created by the lizards?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) Do they have souls?<br /></i></span><br /><i><span style=\"color: rgb(41, 105, 176)\">A: They are Decoys. </span></i><span style=\"color: rgb(41, 105, 176)\">[</span><span style=\"color: rgb(184, 49, 47)\">MJF: The C&#039;s later described them as being probes projected by the Lizard beings</span><span style=\"color: rgb(41, 105, 176)\">]</span><br /><br /><div style=\"text-align: justify\">This is a funny way brings us back full circle to the the pod people of <i>The</i> <i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i> who, as beings grown from alien plants that look like giant marrows, would seem to have a lot in common with the Greys based on the following discussion found in the transcripts:<br />&#8203;</div><i><span style=\"color: rgb(41, 105, 176)\">(T) If this is a standard cybergenetic Gray, the question is how much biological is he?

It flew over the building or that general area, and it had a little kind of antenna on the back of it. You could freeze frame it to see it. And then there were other camera angles that saw another further away, with a more ball-like structure, though it could be the same one. But anyway, it was some kind of an anomalous, unidentified aerial vehicle in the air at the time of the shooting. <b>What was... who owned that?<br /><br />A: Drones.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) And these are 3D drones run by Intel types?<br /><br />A: Yes.</b><br /><br />Q: (Joe) And was it really moving at the speed it seemed to have been?

But above all, I see that the subject is just as complex concerning extraterrestrial drones; either they want to acclimatize us to their presence but at the same time be discreet and “invisible” so as not to raise suspicion about their presence. I find this dichotomous. <br /><br />In the publications following the session, there was also a mention of detoxification concerning the “nano” in our bodies due to Covid vaccines. Even though I haven&#039;t received any vaccines, this is of particular concern to me when we come into contact with people who have been inoculated. So, it was mentioned that acetylcholine-producing nicotine was a good protector and destroyer of this technology. <b>Not smoking and not wanting to start either, so where can we find this element in food?

But above all, I see that the subject is just as complex concerning extraterrestrial drones; either they want to acclimatize us to their presence but at the same time be discreet and “invisible” so as not to raise suspicion about their presence. I find this dichotomous.</b><br /><br />In the publications following the session, there was also a mention of detoxification concerning the “nano” in our bodies due to Covid vaccines. Even though I haven&#039;t received any vaccines, this is of particular concern to me when we come into contact with people who have been inoculated. So, it was mentioned that acetylcholine-producing nicotine was a good protector and destroyer of this technology. <b>Not smoking and not wanting to start either, so where can we find this element in food? Like what was said in this publication:</b><br /><br /><br />And another topic that came up, just as interesting, was the lunar cycle. So, in order not to duplicate, I published my thoughts and results of my research concerning this subject in <a href=\"https://cassiopaea.org/forum/threads/19-year-cycle-lunar-standstill-upcoming.2890/#post-17701\" class=\"link link--internal\">the other thread </a>that was referred to...

Grâce au réseautage et au partage des connaissances transmises par les membres, où je suis très reconnaissante d&#039;avoir accès à autant d&#039;informations, ceci m&#039;amène à réfléchir davantage sur mes actions et mes réflexions sur mon vécu répartie sur ma ligne du temps (passé, présent et futur). <img class=\"smilie smilie--emoji\" alt=\"😍\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f60d.png\" title=\"Smiling face with heart-eyes    :heart_eyes:\" data-shortname=\":heart_eyes:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" /><br /><br />Le sujet des drones ne m&#039;a pas trop surprise puisque lorsque j&#039;ai lu ces informations dans les médias, j&#039;avais tout de suite ressenti que ceci cachait sûrement des activités extraterrestres pour nous surveiller/contrôler comme ça déjà été mentionné dans une autre session du 17 août 2024 mais qui concernait des drones terrestres:<br /><br /><br />Par contre, je ne pensais pas qu&#039;il y avait aussi des drones terrestres qui étaient aussi présent afin de créer des leurres et détourner l&#039;attention. Mais surtout, je constate que le sujet est autant complexe concernant les drones extraterrestes; soit ils veulent nous acclimater à leur présence mais tout en étant discret et &quot;invisible&quot; afin de ne pas lever de soupçon sur leur présence. Je trouve ça dichotomique.<br /><br />Dans les publications suite à la session, il y a aussi eu une mention concernant la désintoxication concernant les &quot;nano&quot; dans notre corps à cause des vaccins Covid. Même si je n&#039;ai reçu aucun vaccin, ceci me préoccupe justement lorsque que nous côtoyons des gens qui ont été inoculés. Donc, il a été mentionné que la nicotine produidant de l&#039;acétylcholine était un bon protecteur et destructeur de cette technologie.

First of all, I have had some contact with a physicist who is interested in the material. And, because of this, I was motivated to pick up a book I had read many years ago about the German occupation of Poland, {The Story of a Secret State by Jan Karski} and there were some very strange things said in this book, and some funny synchronous numbers... It just seemed to be a prototype of the present reality in global terms. My question is: is there some synchronous implication between this contact, the reading of this book when I was 11 years old, and the material we have received through this source?<br /><br />A: Open.<br /><br />Q: (L) You have said that the Holocaust was basically a &#039;practice run&#039; for the ultimate space invasion. Is this invasion supposed to take place as an actual &#039;aliens invading the planet&#039; scenario, or...<br /><br />A: Too many thought patterns at once. Step by step, please.<br /><br /><span style=\"color: rgb(41, 105, 176)\">Q: (L) Let&#039;s boil it down. Was Hitler&#039;s agenda a practice run for a future scenario?<br /><br />A: Close.

The whole picture is seen by seeing the whole scene.<br /><br />Q: (L) Well, I guess that is why I get into so many thought patterns...<br /><br />A: Picture yourself as being at the center of a mosaic.<br /><br />Q: (L) Okay, I know what you are saying, but I just don&#039;t think that there is any way I can DO this!<br /><br />A: Yes you can!<br /><br />Q: (L) Okay. Okay. This whole situation, this Polish connection, this German connection, the American and alien things, the soldier/Nephilim thing, these are all manifestations of a Realm Border Crossing, am I correct?<br /><br />A: Close.<br /><br />Q: (L) And some of the manifestations of a Realm Border Crossing are that some people graduate or transition to 4th density, that their awareness changes, everything changes, the playing field is leveled. So, what happened in Germany was a &#039;practice run&#039; but what is going to happen is that the &#039;playing field&#039; is going to be leveled, so it will not be exactly the same scenario, is this a correct assessment?<br /><br />A: Maybe. Alright, my dear, you want the facts, so we will give them to you, and hopefully you will comprehend. If not now, then when necessary maybe... Fact number one: All there is is lessons. Fact two: this is one big school. Fact three: Timing as you perceive it, is never, NEVER definite. Fact four: What is to happen, as you state it, is a ways off, and will not occur until you have reached that point on the learning cycle, and you are not close yet. Now ponder before more facts are given!!<br /><br />Q: (L) Okay, this being one infinite school, and we all seem to be wandering around in the darkness...<br /><br />A: Fact five: The learning cycle is variable, and progress along it is determined by events and circumstances as they unfold.<br /><br />Q: (L) So, the events and circumstances of our lives, individually and collectively, can indicate where we are on this learning cycle? And we are asking to have things told to us, or revealed to us about things which are, in themselves, the necessary lessons? And it would be virtually useless to be told about them since they must be experienced?<br /><br />A: Partly correct. If you want hints, then hints shall we give.

Next question:<br /><br />(Saman) Can we know a bit more in general layman terms how this stage of the Wave cycle is causing the thinning of the veil that normally hides hyperdimensional activity from 3D STS beings?<br /><br />A: There are no specific layman terms. But in general just think of 3D merging into 4D.<br /><br />(Joe) Can we, it&#039;s not on the drones, but it may be related to the thinning of the veil. We&#039;re just wondering about Leia who had an accident.<br /><br />(Andromeda) We assume a fall.<br /><br />(Joe) We assume she had a fall, but anyway, she broke two ribs a few days ago. Don&#039;t know how. Outside somewhere. It was anomalous. It was weird. Strange. Was that...<br /><br />(Chu) What happened to her?<br /><br />A: Encounter with energy anomaly.<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) Did this thing cause her to jump or fall or something like that?<br /><br />A: Pushed.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) What was the nature of the energy anomaly?<br /><br />A: Like an energy &quot;wind&quot;.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Is that related to thinning of the veil?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) And did something similar happen to Falkor that same evening?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Was it kind of like a wind that something he ran into or some kind of a...?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) It just hit him?<br /><br />(Joe) So he didn&#039;t see anything. The thing is, he ran off or something as if he was aware of something.<br /><br />A: Animals have a different perception of energy.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So it wasn&#039;t something that was particularly malevolent or benevolent?<br /><br />A: No<br /><br />Q: (L) But, I mean, you can&#039;t say that a hurricane is malevolent or benevolent, but it...<br /><br />(Niall) Falkor started yelping like he was in pain.<br /><br />(Joe) Well, he ran into something. Something hit him.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Something hit him.<br /><br />(L) Yeah.<br /><br />(Joe) Like an energy wind.<br /><br />(L) Or a blockage or something like that.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Poor little puppies!<br /><br />(Joe) It was more or less outside your window.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, it was outside my office window. It was weird.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Is there anything we can do to protect the puppies against this kind of thing?<br /><br />A: Present times are very unstable for all beings. Awareness and vigilance protect.<br /><br />Q: (L) All right. I have to take a momentary break.<br /><br />[Laura leaves...]<br /><br />(Joe) Poor Leia!<br /><br />(Niall) She was pushed enough by something...<br /><br />(Joe) Deliberately.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Poor little honey... It didn&#039;t make sense that she would fall.<br /><br />(Niall) She must have been on the ledge.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Yeah, she must have been close enough, but I mean, it just doesn&#039;t make sense that she would fall. It&#039;s not slippery. She doesn&#039;t get way up close to the edge unless we&#039;re there.<br /><br />(Niall) An energy wind... Well, the follow-up question would be, are humans subjected to random energy winds as well?<br /><br />(Chu) Probably.<br /><br />(Joe) That&#039;s a good question. Why it would happen with the two dogs as opposed to...<br /><br />(Andromeda) ...to humans.<br /><br />(Niall) And why on the same day?<br /><br />(Andromeda) Right. Oh, we could ask about the starlings.<br /><br />(Ark) I wonder if we are in energy anomaly special zone. I remember these cars crashing nearby for no reason, you know? No one there and weren&#039;t there three? Three accidents.<br /><br />(Andromeda) I think they said it was because there was a bubble over us here.<br /><br />(Joe) A bubble of protection, yeah.<br /><br />(Jefferson) My son&#039;s car flew up in the wind two summers ago, And we asked the Cs.<br /><br />(Andromeda) That&#039;s right!<br /><br />(Jefferson) Yeah, the car flew up and then landed upside down.<br /><br />(Joe) Right.<br /><br />(Jefferson) Some energy difference.<br /><br />(Niall) So yeah, it obviously does hit people then.<br /><br />(Ark) But cars are not driven by animals.<br /><br />(Joe) No, not yet.<br /><br />(Niall) Except in Groundhog Day.<br /><br />(Chu) It could be different types of winds too. Some that affect animals, some that affect people.<br /><br />(Ark) Yeah.<br /><br />(Joe) When the wind is in the east. [Laughter; it&#039;s a reference to the BBC series, &quot;Bleak House&quot;]<br /><br />[Laura returns]<br /><br />(Andromeda) We&#039;ve got two more questions.<br /><br />(L) Oh, I thought of a question too.<br /><br />(Andromeda) You go first.<br /><br />(L) Can these energy winds be created or stimulated by other things such as...? I mean, in our reality, if a helicopter lands on your front lawn, there&#039;s a whole lot of wind. Is there something similar to that with these energy winds? Is it evidence of some other kind of hyperdimensional activity?<br /><br />(Andromeda) Like an effect of something else...<br /><br />(L) Yeah.<br /><br />A: Indeed and usually.<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) And can they affect humans? I mean, this was both of the doggies in one day.<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) Oh, and is there anything to the starlings that have been coming a lot more than usual and landing in our trees?<br /><br />(L) Is there anything, as in what?<br /><br />(Andromeda) As in any energetic related thing?<br /><br />A: Yes. Signs all over the earth.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Do the accidents or the events with the two dogs imply that there was some activity interested in this house here, or at that time?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Joe) And what were they up to?<br /><br />A: Trying to read and influence.<br /><br />Q: (Niall) Was there one of those probes nearby?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Niall) Argh! I never saw it. Why didn&#039;t it show itself? Show your face!<br /><br />(Gaby) I saw, well, I thought I saw a red light, but I figured it was the Christmas lights.<br /><br />(L) So, does the protective bubble we have erected during some of our activities help protect us against things like that?<br /><br />A: For the most part, yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) So we need to shore up our defenses.<br /><br />A: Yes. And stay aware.<br /><br /><br />L) All right. Is there anything we need to know that we didn&#039;t ask?<br /><br />A: Stay alert. Things can get hectic!

I&#039;ve had so much going on that I&#039;m just now catching up but the above excerpt in particular strikes a cord.  From the last session to this one has been a series of events that have me wondering what the universe is trying to tell me. <br /><br />Quick run down is that as I was washing the car, I determined that I didn&#039;t have a spare tire, ordered one and before it could come in, I had a flat tire when I picked up a half a pair of scissors (in front of a tire store) on the way home from work one evening.<br /><br />With deer season in full swing and knowing that they were out on the road I live on, I was driving home from work again, very slowly only to have one jump out in front of the car and I hit him or her in the rump on it&#039;s right side.  It lived and dashed off but a few days later while in the truck, I swear it was the same deer because it was limping on the right back leg, was standing in the middle of the road causing me to swerve to avoid it.  It was moving slowly whether it was the same injured deer or not. <br /><br />Then the last car related incident was on 12/03 on the way home from dinner out with my roommate for her belated birthday.  It was in a round a bout, where we were going to make (the equivalent) of a left turn and a kid tried to merge in the lane while I was still using it.  It was a minor fender bender and neither of us were hurt.  The next day as I was reading the accident report, I noticed that the kids birthday was the same as my late son&#039;s and at that intersection used to be a pizza place that my son had worked at briefly.  Soooo... I was wondering if my son (Trey) was trying to tell me something in a round a bout way? :)<br /><br />The energies that were surrounging us seemed quite intense at times and this passage may have been part of the answer.","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":14181,"user":"Wandering Star","id":1226083,"date":"2025-01-08T20:33:31+0100","text":"<blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 11403\" data-quote=\"Sylvia\" data-source=\"post: 1225834\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1225834\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1225834\">Sylvia said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">Thank you for the session which, as always, is fascinating, enriching and leads us to see beyond the answers given by the Cassiopaeans. Thanks to the networking and sharing of knowledge passed on by the members, where I&#039;m very grateful to have access to so much information, this leads me to reflect more on my actions and reflections on my experiences spread over my timeline (past, present and future). <img class=\"smilie smilie--emoji\" alt=\"😍\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f60d.png\" title=\"Smiling face with heart-eyes    :heart_eyes:\" data-shortname=\":heart_eyes:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" /><br /><br />The subject of drones didn&#039;t surprise me too much, since when I read about them in the media, I immediately felt that this was surely hiding extraterrestrial activities to monitor/control us, as already mentioned in another session on August 17, 2024, but which concerned terrestrial drones:<br /><br /><br />On the other hand, I didn&#039;t think that terrestrial drones were also present to create decoys and divert attention. But above all, I see that the subject is just as complex concerning extraterrestrial drones; either they want to acclimatize us to their presence but at the same time be discreet and “invisible” so as not to raise suspicion about their presence. I find this dichotomous.<br /><br />In the publications following the session, there was also a mention of detoxification concerning the “nano” in our bodies due to Covid vaccines. Even though I haven&#039;t received any vaccines, this is of particular concern to me when we come into contact with people who have been inoculated. So, it was mentioned that acetylcholine-producing nicotine was a good protector and destroyer of this technology. <b>Not smoking and not wanting to start either, so where can we find this element in food? Like what was said in this publication:</b><br /><br /><br />And another topic that came up, just as interesting, was the lunar cycle. So, in order not to duplicate, I published my thoughts and results of my research concerning this subject in <a href=\"https://cassiopaea.org/forum/threads/19-year-cycle-lunar-standstill-upcoming.2890/#post-17701\" class=\"link link--internal\">the other thread </a>that was referred to...

Grâce au réseautage et au partage des connaissances transmises par les membres, où je suis très reconnaissante d&#039;avoir accès à autant d&#039;informations, ceci m&#039;amène à réfléchir davantage sur mes actions et mes réflexions sur mon vécu répartie sur ma ligne du temps (passé, présent et futur). <img class=\"smilie smilie--emoji\" alt=\"😍\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f60d.png\" title=\"Smiling face with heart-eyes    :heart_eyes:\" data-shortname=\":heart_eyes:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" /><br /><br />Le sujet des drones ne m&#039;a pas trop surprise puisque lorsque j&#039;ai lu ces informations dans les médias, j&#039;avais tout de suite ressenti que ceci cachait sûrement des activités extraterrestres pour nous surveiller/contrôler comme ça déjà été mentionné dans une autre session du 17 août 2024 mais qui concernait des drones terrestres:<br /><br /><br />Par contre, je ne pensais pas qu&#039;il y avait aussi des drones terrestres qui étaient aussi présent afin de créer des leurres et détourner l&#039;attention. Mais surtout, je constate que le sujet est autant complexe concernant les drones extraterrestes; soit ils veulent nous acclimater à leur présence mais tout en étant discret et &quot;invisible&quot; afin de ne pas lever de soupçon sur leur présence. Je trouve ça dichotomique.<br /><br />Dans les publications suite à la session, il y a aussi eu une mention concernant la désintoxication concernant les &quot;nano&quot; dans notre corps à cause des vaccins Covid. Même si je n&#039;ai reçu aucun vaccin, ceci me préoccupe justement lorsque que nous côtoyons des gens qui ont été inoculés. Donc, il a été mentionné que la nicotine produidant de l&#039;acétylcholine était un bon protecteur et destructeur de cette technologie. Ne fumant pas et ne voulant pas non plus commencé, <b>alors où pouvons-nous retrouver cet élément dans la nourriture?

The account is also given that <b>the god visits the island every nineteen years</b>, the period in which the return of the stars to the same place in the heavens is accomplished, and for this reason the Greeks call the nineteen-year period the “year of Meton”. At the time of this appearance of the god he both plays on the cithara and <u>dances</u> continuously the night through from the vernal equinox until the rising of the Pleiades, expressing in this manner his delight in his successes. And the kings of this city and the supervisors of the sacred precinct are called Boreades, since they are descendants of Boreas, and the succession to these positions is always kept in their family.&quot;194</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>The following may have relevance:<br /><span style=\"color: rgb(61, 142, 185)\"><b>Dancing aligned power cells.</b></span><br /><a href=\"https://cassiopaea.org/forum/threads/session-29-july-2006.20278/\" class=\"link link--internal\">Session 29 July 2006</a><br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 17\" data-quote=\"Laura\" data-source=\"post: 203396\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=203396\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-203396\">Laura said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">Q: (Atriedes) Did the people from Kantek bring a martial art with them?<br /><br />A: Of course, how do you think they destroyed their planet?<br /><br />Q: (Atriedes) is this the martial art that eventually made it to China?<br /><br />A: Not china, further back than that.

I recently picked up doing qigong, a lot of which for foundations is just standing still in the zhen zhaung pose in nature. From my own limited practice and the inquiry with my teacher, the goal overall of those specific poses was to retrain the tissues of the body to piezoelectrically conduct qi/information up from the earth, into tissues and spaces where that information would be transformed and refined further. Elaborations on stances involved learning to have minimal necessary tension for maintaining the posture, so qi/information flows unobstructed, as well as to sort of create vessels and spaces in the body where qi/information can be stored like a battery (the most common example is the dantian below the navel).<br /><br />From 09 June 2009:<br /><br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"\" data-quote=\"\" data-source=\"\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">(L) Well, if you think about a group of people who are setting up these massive stones like they were pieces of styrofoam. The stones collect energy and information. They then transduce the energy or amplify it. These people know things about movement, dances or spinning or something, that enables them to behave in concert with the stones so that they all become part of a grand machine that does things! All of the legends talk about stylized dances and the oldest things about Stonehenge say that it was the Temple of Apollo and that Apollo danced there all night at certain periods of time. Every 19 years, I believe. When you think about that, and the other places Apollo appeared, the inversions and redactions of the legends, and we come to these magical stones that produce things. Then we come to the head of Bran the Blessed which supposedly produced endless supplies of bread and fish or whatever else was desired. Bran&#039;s head was the giver of all good things. But more than that, it was an oracle. It could speak. And here we have the idea of a similar function for Stonehenge: both an oracle as well as a giver of blessings and bounty. Anything you wanted or needed it provided for you. If you wanted to go somewhere, it transported you as in the legends of the flying carpets. It was magic transportation. All of these things are associated, when you track them back far enough, with a stone. The stones did everything.</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote><br />So, there is a connection between the stones storing energy for the transduction of higher-order information from higher realms, and dances or arts which had the practice of building up a similar charge of energy in our own bodies. Of course, with our intentions and knowledge and awareness acting as the tuners.<br /><br />If people intend to utilize the 19 year lunar cycle to conduct creative energies, maybe it would be beneficial to do some wuji/zhen zhaung first to build up the information in their bodies further and improve the transduction of higher information?","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":11878,"user":"AllFreq","id":1227557,"date":"2025-01-18T14:41:37+0100","text":"<blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 19873\" data-quote=\"Ricardo\" data-source=\"post: 1226003\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1226003\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1226003\">Ricardo said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">Also , (natural ) silk.<br /><br /> Session 2 December 2000 :<br /><br /><b>Q:</b> (L) The alchemists say that to protect the body from outside frequencies, one should wear silk.
