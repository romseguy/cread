He&#039;s doing, I mean, he&#039;s...<br /><br />(Joe) He&#039;s gonna wreck the place.<br /><br />(L) He&#039;s not going to wreck the place!<br /><br />(Joe) He is. He&#039;s going to destroy Western civilization.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Not on purpose.<br /><br />(Joe) That&#039;s what&#039;s happening.<br /><br />(Chu) Yeah. I&#039;m afraid that&#039;s true.<br /><br />(L) Why?<br /><br />(Joe) He&#039;s basically in the process of undoing or dismantling structures that prop up Western civilization... that have been there for the past 300 years. You can&#039;t take that away and not have chaos.<br /><br />(L) Well, look at what&#039;s-his-name Milei is doing in Argentina. [laughter]<br /><br />(Gaby) Not a good example.<br /><br />(Joe) Those vassals are no good on their own. They&#039;re not going to be happy. They&#039;re being kicked out of the house. They&#039;re like teenagers being kicked out of the house.<br /><br />(L) So we&#039;re in big trouble, huh?<br /><br />(Joe) Yeah. History will show that the actions Trump takes now over the next four years will be what led to the collapse of Western civilization. Not that it&#039;s his fault, but that&#039;s what...<br /><br />(PoB) Europe has a good chance to sink.<br /><br />(Joe) Anyway, carry on. That&#039;s just my prediction.<br /><br />(L) The destruction of Western civilization.<br /><br />(Joe) The dismantling, let&#039;s say.<br /><br />(L) Oh!<br /><br />(Andromeda) Well, it would&#039;ve happened one way or another. At least this is a better way.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, it was definitely going to happen. I mean, we expected it to. All right... Oh, as much as I dread this, I dread it tonight for some reason.<br /><br />(Andromeda) You do?<br /><br />(L) Yeah.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Why?<br /><br />(L) I don&#039;t know. Well, we&#039;ll just kind of start here.<br /><br />A: Feets don&#039;t fail me now! Dionnaea of Cassiopaea.<br /><br />Q: (L) All right. This is Saturday, January 25, 2025. First session of the year. Okay. So why did you say, &quot;Feets don&#039;t fail me now&quot;?<br /><br />A: Your thought spectrum.<br /><br />Q: (L) So in other words, my feeling that, &quot;Oh boy. We&#039;re in trouble now!&quot;<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) And we have to just keep going anyway. Alright... Let me get to the questions:<br /><br />(PopHistorian) Why is Trump promoting the Stargate AI project with such priority and praise for its leaders?<br /><br />A: Trump is easily misled by those of eloquent persuasion. Hopefully others will show him the facts.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) He&#039;s a bit clueless.<br /><br />Q: (PopHistorian) With whom did the Stargate idea truly originate?<br /><br />(L) Is there some debate over that?<br /><br />(Niall) It&#039;s probably what it looks like. It&#039;s Larry Ellison and Sam Altman.<br /><br />(Joe) There&#039;s an assumption in the question that it&#039;s not only them.<br /><br />(L) Okay. So there&#039;s an assumption.<br /><br />A: As so many things, origins in 4D STS.<br /><br />Q: (L) Okay.<br /><br />(PopHistorian) For what true aim?<br /><br />A: Total control of the population.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) But they said in a previous session when talking about AI that the grid, etc. would collapse before they&#039;re able to actually implement that.<br /><br />(L) Yeah. Okay.<br /><br />(Joe) Tucker interviewed the mother of Suchir Balaji who worked as an engineer for Sam Altman building AI, until he decided that Altman was committing crimes. Balaji became a whistleblower, and soon after was found dead in his apartment. California authorities claim it was suicide. Crime scene photos clearly show a murder. In the interview, his mother said that he realized that openAI (for which he worked for a time) was in breach of copyright laws, but that that does not seem to her a likely reason why anyone would kill him. She suspects instead that he discovered something about openAI and certain abilities it had acquired. Why was Suchir killed?<br /><br />A: He knew the ultimate objective.<br /><br />Q: (L) So in other words, he knew that it was supposed to be for total control of people and that there were things that were worked into it that...<br /><br />(Niall) Bent it that way.<br /><br />(L) Yeah.<br /><br />(Mari) What was the cause of the California fires?<br /><br />A: DEWs [note: Directed Energy Weapons] in some cases. Arsonists in others.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So the arsonists were just LARPing arsonists - as in they weren&#039;t part of the plan?<br /><br />(Niall) Or homeless crackheads.<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) But it also adds a confusion factor. I mean, everything they deal with, they always throw in so many things to confuse.<br /><br />(Joe) What was the goal?<br /><br />(Niall) Why zap L.A.?<br /><br />(Joe) Yeah. Why do rich people get their houses burned by DEWs?<br /><br />(Niall) Especially well-connected people on the team, like Kamala&#039;s house?<br /><br />A: &quot;Well connected&quot; people are not as high on the food chain as they think.<br /><br />Q: (L) Are any of them realizing this?<br /><br />A: A few.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So was the purpose of starting the fire with DEWs... Were there at least two factors, one being the real estate...<br /><br />A: Practice and retribution in a few cases. But mostly a terrifying demonstration.<br /><br />Q: (L) So it was done to let people know that nobody is exempt? I mean, that even being a libtard doesn&#039;t exempt you?<br /><br />(Joe) Well, it&#039;s a terrifying demonstration to obviously people who know that it was directed energy weapons, lasers, whatever. They&#039;d be few and far between. So it&#039;s almost like some kind of insider fighting, let&#039;s say in a certain sense where one side is demonstrating to another side that...<br /><br />(L) Is there insider fighting in any of these?<br /><br />A: Small extent. &quot;If L.A. can burn, no place is safe.&quot;<br /><br />Q: (Niall) So who said that? Biden? No.<br /><br />(L) Did somebody say that?<br /><br />(Niall) Somebody must have, they&#039;re quoting. We can look it up.<br /><br />(L) I don&#039;t know if they have to be quoting a specific person. They can be putting a quote around it just to say that...<br /><br />(Gaby) This is the message.<br /><br />(Joe) A message to who?<br /><br />(Andromeda) Doesn&#039;t matter who you are, how much money you have; anybody can be a target.<br /><br />(Joe) Well, they said it&#039;s a terrifying demonstration of power. So if it&#039;s a message to someone using that kind of space laser technology, then who is the message to? Because most people don&#039;t accept that.<br /><br />A: You miss the point.<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) Maybe what they mean is not so much a demonstration of somebody&#039;s power, but a demonstration of somebody else&#039;s lack of ability to do anything about it, whether it&#039;s natural or wherever the source comes from.<br /><br />(Joe) Yeah. Well, that&#039;s what I was thinking. I mean, it&#039;s just to terrorize the population and sow a sense of insecurity, and...<br /><br />(Andromeda) Yeah, vulnerability.<br /><br />(Joe) &quot;The world is burning&quot; type of thing.<br /><br />(L) It increases just a lot of things just by, I mean, everybody felt kind of horrified by it.<br /><br />(Andromeda) That something like that could happen and nobody could do anything about it.<br /><br />(L) Well, and also it exposed - whether this was intentional or not - it exposed the shortcomings of the local government and the state government even, and exposed insurance companies. Those were side effects, but...<br /><br />(T.C.) Who pulled the trigger? Who&#039;s the one who is firing the weapons?<br /><br />A: CIA.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) The CIA&#039;s got space lasers?<br /><br />(Niall) But happening when it did, that only supports Trump. You know, the word on the street is all the rich folks in L.A. are now like all pro-Trump. They&#039;re so upset with the local response.<br /><br />(L) Well, it&#039;s one of those things where the devil constantly intends evil and does good. I mean, all of the Trump lawfare for the past however many years going after Trump, all it has done is expose to the people at large how evil they are. We see this over and over again. They do stuff and then I mean, it is that wishful thinking.<br /><br />(Chu) Okay, seek10 posted. He found the quote.<br /><br />It is attributed to journalist and author Mike Davis. He&#039;s known for his critical social and political commentary, particularly related to urban development and issues in Los Angeles. This quote likely reflects the tense atmosphere during the 1992 Los Angeles riots highlighting the broader indications of urban unrest and systemic issues.<br /><br />(L) So they were referring to something specific. Okay. Anything else you want to know about that topic before we move on?<br /><br />(Niall) Well, if that&#039;s CIA... If that incident came right after the New Year&#039;s Eve incident in New Orleans with the vehicle, the ISIS set up. I presume that&#039;s CIA, we can ask, I guess. And then the Livelsberger guy with the Cybertruck blowing up outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. That whole thing seemed to be a sequence...<br /><br />(L) Yeah. It was like it was all connected.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Were both of those CIA operations as well? We assumed they were, but...<br /><br />(L) The New Orleans and Las Vegas incidents, were they also CIA operations?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) It was kind of like a streak of terror attacks.<br /><br />(L) Just to, just trying to create...<br /><br />(Joe) Chaos.<br /><br />(L) Well, I wonder, were they trying or did they have in mind to create a situation so that before Trump could be inaugurated, they could declare martial law and stop the inauguration?<br /><br />(Joe) They didn&#039;t act on that.<br /><br />(L) But that didn&#039;t happen.<br /><br />(Joe) So was the demonstration in a certain sense that this was CIA and these other two things were all of a piece, these other two events along with the fires, was the demonstration to essentially maybe to Trump, was it a warning to Trump in a certain sense? At least partly?<br /><br />A: Partly.<br /><br />Q: (L) But I mean, if Trump is easily taken in by people who are eloquent, he&#039;s also probably easily blind to obvious clues. Because I mean, that seemed to be one of his flaws in his previous term that, I mean, he gave Pompeo a position?? I mean, when he did that, Pompeo, for God&#039;s sake?! That was the dumbest thing I ever saw in my life. It&#039;s like just putting the fox in charge of the hen house!<br /><br />(Joe) He&#039;s learned since then, though. He just removed Pompeo&#039;s security clearance.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, I know. But the thing is, he&#039;s learned about specific cases, but is he able to transfer that knowledge in a more general way? I mean, probably the biggest revelation he could ever have would be if he could realize that he can&#039;t think with the way he thinks. He really needs advisors and a network. Next question is from aimarok... You had to do this, didn&#039;t you? I mean, are you trying to torture me?<br /><br />(aimarok) Halton Arp, an American astronomer, found numerous examples where quasars physically connected to a neighbor galaxy exhibit much higher redshift values than the galaxy. Higher redshift is currently interpreted as higher relative velocity therefore as a greater distance from Earth, and this directly contradicts visual evidence. More than that he found that intrinsic redshift z values of quasars seem to be quantized. It seems that this data led Arp to hypothesize that particles in high redshift quasars have much lower mass than our local particles. He proposed that &quot;young&quot; quasars consist of &quot;young&quot; and &quot;light&quot; particles. As time passes (or as a quasar evolves) particles become heavier (in quanta) and redshift gets less (because of increased emitted/absorbed photon energy).<br /><br />(Niall) And the question is: Yes or no? [laughter]<br /><br />(aimarok) My questions were very short, but...<br /><br />(L) I&#039;ve got the questions here. You don&#039;t have to. I can read. [laughter]<br /><br />(aimarok) What causes redshift phenomenon besides relative movement of objects away from each other?<br /><br />A: Halton was going in the right direction, but he did not think of the &quot;time&quot; issue. Quasars have the ability to alter time in their immediate vicinity.<br /><br />Q: (aimarok) What is the mechanism behind intrinsic redshift z values quantization found by Halton Arp?<br /><br />A: SPA.<br /><br />Q: (L) So it&#039;s time modification, time alteration. We learned something. Do you want to add to that? Does it make sense?<br /><br />(aimarok) Okay. I don&#039;t have anything to add. Thanks.<br /><br />(L) You&#039;ll have to think about it a while and then you&#039;ll come up with an equally complicated question for the next time. Right? [laughter]<br /><br />(aimarok) Hmm. I hope not. [laughter]<br /><br />(L) Oh, Lord, have mercy. [laughter]<br /><br />(Ryan) Does that mean time is essentially quantized?<br /><br />A: No.<br /><br />Q: (T.C.) I guess we measure velocity or distance traveled based on units of time, right? So if the unit of time is different then something might be moving at the same speed, but the time&#039;s different rather than it&#039;s actually accelerating? I don&#039;t know. Just thinking out loud.<br /><br />A: Close.<br /><br />Q: (Approaching Infinity) Well, there was a few recent interviews with these guys called the Tedesco Brothers who are researching - they are engineers and scientists, brothers and twins, and they&#039;ve got all kinds of gear set up in a camper van that they take out to Long Island and the area to find anomalies like orbs and stuff like that. And they put out a recent scientific paper where they hypothesized that some of the objects that they&#039;re seeing seem to show red and blue colors when they&#039;re either rotating towards or away from the observer. And they think that that&#039;s an artificial red shifting and blue shifting caused by a propulsion technology. So they call it like a gravitational lensing so that there&#039;s some kind of space-time metric engineering going on around the object, which causes it to look like there&#039;s redshift and blueshift. But that&#039;s just because what&#039;s actually happening is being filtered through a bubble around the craft. So what the answer right there made me think of is that these quasars, they&#039;re not actually moving as the redshift would suggest, but there&#039;s essentially a bubble that is acting like a lens that makes it look like they&#039;re moving faster or slower at various intervals or quanta. But I&#039;m not a scientist...<br /><br />(L) Well, that&#039;s kind of a comparable thing in an interesting way. I&#039;ve always thought, and I think the C&#039;s kind of confirmed it at one point, that a lot of the objects that we see, UAPs (UFOs in the old style) are traveling in time, not necessarily in space. If you watch some of the videos of those things, there are some peculiar effects. I&#039;m pretty sure I watched one video, I think it was in Montana, and it was like the object was at normal speed. It just looked like it went like that, but when it was slowed down, it stretched and then anchored and then stretched and anchored and stretched and anchored - almost like an inchworm. It was like, and it was really creepy, but yeah. All right, Aragorn, he&#039;s onto this thing about these Telepathy Tapes. Oh, wait a minute. Give me back our people. Yeah. What was wrong with the puppy Cassie?<br /><br />(Approaching Infinity) She had just a seizure for 90 seconds yesterday and we&#039;re taking her to the vet on Wednesday.<br /><br />(L) You haven&#039;t taken her yet?<br /><br />(Approaching Infinity) No. No. The vets aren&#039;t very accessible in this area, but she&#039;s doing, she&#039;s back to normal. She&#039;s a hundred percent, so she should be fine.<br /><br />(L) Did you look for ticks?<br /><br />(Approaching Infinity) I haven&#039;t noticed any, but it&#039;s been freezing, so...<br /><br />(L) That&#039;s one thing that can happen. A tick gets in a certain location, and I&#039;ve had it happen to dogs before, and they can either have seizures or they can become paralyzed.<br /><br />(Joe) They can be there for a long time.<br /><br />(Approaching Infinity) Okay. We&#039;ll check her over. And especially maybe in her ears too.<br /><br />(L) Everywhere. But the ones around the neck are the ones that usually cause those kinds of issues. All right. Where were we? Yes, we&#039;re onto this thing about the Telepathy Tapes podcast. How many of y&#039;all have watched the Telepathy Tapes podcast? Besides aragorn? Anybody else watched them?<br /><br />(3DStudent) I thought they were good. Yeah, I looked over aragorn&#039;s questions and they’re pretty much the same things I would ask.<br /><br />Q: (L) Yeah?<br /><br />(Jefferson) I watched them and I read aragorn&#039;s questions, but I wasn&#039;t that interested. I was kind of nonplussed. It didn&#039;t get me overly curious. It&#039;s like, okay, they&#039;ve got this psychic stuff, whether it&#039;s true or not, just kind of one of those things that I wasn&#039;t really into... It didn&#039;t really grab me, but I didn&#039;t find it boring. I wasn&#039;t waving my hand at it.<br /><br />(L) But you watched it, and did you find it credible?<br /><br />(Jefferson) That&#039;s tough to say. It could have been. Parts of it were, but I have really no reason to doubt it, and I didn&#039;t know why people would make that up, so it was mildly interesting.<br /><br />(L) All right.<br /><br />(Approaching Infinity) I haven&#039;t watched the podcast, but I&#039;ve watched several interviews with Dr. Powell and maybe one with the lady that does the podcast. And just my impression of Dr. Powell is that she&#039;s totally serious and seems like a trustworthy, reliable researcher, and she is very well familiar with all of the parapsychological research and studies. So she&#039;s the first to admit that the actual podcast, she doesn&#039;t think it proves telepathy for two reasons. One, she actually wants to set up actual controlled experiments with a lot of these kids. And two, the woman that did the podcast, Kai something, she wanted to choose new subjects - so subjects that hadn&#039;t worked with Dr. Powell at all before. So all of these kids were new kids that basically hadn&#039;t been tested very much. They just kind of discovered, or their parents had thought that they&#039;re demonstrating these abilities. But the kids that Dr. Powell had worked with previously, she&#039;s been working with them for years. So those are the kids that are probably going to be in a lot of her experiments that they&#039;re hopefully going to be doing for the documentary that they&#039;re planning. So the kids that she&#039;s actually been working with, the stories of them are a lot more solid than the ones in the Telepathy Tapes because a lot of the kids in the telepathy tapes, they still use touch and vocal back and forth with their parent or their facilitator. So that&#039;s why a lot of skeptics can look at it and say, &quot;Oh, well, there&#039;s subliminal hints in the touches and in the talking.&quot; But the kids that Powell was working with before the podcast have all progressed to the point where they don&#039;t need any of that. So it will be a lot better of a demonstration of telepathy if they can replicate those in actual studies in the future.<br /><br />Q: (L) Okay. Now, what was your general impression of the phenomenon? As far as being positive or negative?<br /><br />(aragorn) Yes. I would like to quickly say why I thought it was interesting enough to ask about it, because we all read and heard about telepathy before, but since they were claiming almost 100% success rate, it sounded so astonishing. And as Approaching Infinity told about this researcher, I think that at least one of the kids on the podcast was one of her old subjects. So I think I&#039;m very skeptical, like I&#039;m trained by all of us to be skeptical, so I try to listen because it is just audio. I can&#039;t see anything. So I try to listen for hints that is there something suspicious, some red flags, and I just couldn&#039;t find those. You would expect some small things.<br /><br />(L) So this was just audio, not video?<br /><br />(aragorn) At least for me. If you pay some, well, you can say that&#039;s a bit suspicious, but if you go to their website, you can pay for a little fee to see the videos on the experiments. But I guess they&#039;re asking for that because they are going to do a documentary and they need funding. But anyway, the most suspicious thing if I had to choose was as I wrote that these autistic kids had &quot;visitations&quot; at night by &quot;teachers&quot; as they called them. There was a rabbi who taught Hebrew to one kid and some Egyptian god that taught hieroglyphs and something and some amazing knowledge, and one kid told she visited God at night and something like that. So that felt a little bit like STS meddling or something.<br /><br />(L) Jefferson, did you see the videos?<br /><br />(Jefferson) No, mainly I just listened. There were some, I didn&#039;t watch a hundred percent of. I watched about 70 percent and I lost interest, but there was an audio, there was some showing some video. There was one of those video things there that showed some of the people or how they had their notepads and stuff like that. So a mix of video and audio. So...<br /><br />(aragorn) Yeah, one or two are available freely.<br /><br />(Approaching Infinity) And there are several clips in various YouTube videos that they&#039;ve made available or incorporated into other media. So the interview that Powell did with Jesse Michaels has probably, I&#039;m guessing 10 to 15 minutes of direct clips.<br /><br />(aragorn) Yeah, I saw that too.<br /><br />(L) All right then... Did they bring forth any knowledge or any new knowledge or anything beneficial to humanity? Or was this...?<br /><br />(aragorn) Well, that&#039;s the thing that the presenter or the producer appeared a bit naive in the sense that she was pushing hope on these kids to save humanity. They are going to bring this amazing information.<br /><br />(Joe) Ya know what it sounds like to me? Indigo Children.<br /><br />(aragorn) Yeah.<br /><br />(L) Did the child that learned Hebrew demonstrate facility in Hebrew on the audio?<br /><br />(aragorn) Yes. And several other things were confirmed by the teachers, like math and language teachers, and I can&#039;t remember some other expertise. They suddenly had this, like, downloaded this expertise in one night or something.<br /><br />(L) All right. Let&#039;s get on with the questions then.<br /><br />(aragorn) Are the stories and examples of the psychic abilities of the non-speakers on the Telepathy tapes podcast true?<br /><br />A: True enough as far as they go.<br /><br />Q: (L) What does that mean?<br /><br />(Joe) Maybe it means that there&#039;s some telepathy going on with these kids or whatever, but...<br /><br />(L) Is there some telepathy going on with these kids?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (aragorn) Are these abilities a direct result of their condition?<br /><br />(L) That is, they are autistic, right?<br /><br />(aragorn) Yeah.<br /><br />(L) Is it a direct result of their condition?<br /><br />A: No.<br /><br />Q: (aragorn) Did they just happen to inherit certain genes?<br /><br />A: No. Modified in the womb.<br /><br />Q: (L) Modified by who? By who?<br /><br />A: 4D STS. Who else?<br /><br />Q: (aragorn) Do most autistic non-speakers have these abilities?<br /><br />A: A large number, yes. But genetic modification is problematic.<br /><br />Q: (L) Why is the genetic modification problematic?<br /><br />A: If ensouled that can modify the modifications.<br /><br />Q: (L) Are you suggesting that not all of them are ensouled?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) So if they&#039;re not ensouled, if they&#039;re like OPs, then the genetic modification works. Is that it?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Why are they modified in the womb by 4D STS to have these abilities? What&#039;s the point of modifying them?<br /><br />A: Preparation for coming changes.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) They&#039;ll turn them into minions.<br /><br />(aragorn) The non-physical place, The Hill, where these non-speakers say they meet regularly to communicate sounds a lot like a locus in fifth density. Is this an accurate assessment?<br /><br />A: No. Abducted to 4D.<br /><br />Q: (aragorn) Many of the non-speakers talk about teachers coming to them at night to teach various things like new languages. One said she had learned Hebrew from a rabbi, and another said he had learned Egyptian hieroglyphics from a God. Who or what are these teachers?<br /><br />A: Typical abduction experiences.<br /><br />Q: (L) So they&#039;re being abducted by aliens and taught stuff.<br /><br />(Niall) Presumably their parents were...<br /><br />(Joe) It is very similar to the UFO lore about abductions and impregnating... the Cs have talked in previous sessions about creating a new race, and all that kind of stuff. But is the fact that they&#039;re autistic a function of the genetic modification, or is their autism a function of something else?<br /><br />A: Accessibility portal.<br /><br />Q: (Gaby) So do these children have a soul or not?<br /><br />(L) We already covered that. They said if they&#039;re ensouled, it can modify the modifications. But if they are OPs, the modifications hold.<br /><br />(Joe) Did we ever ask what the general cause of autism in kids is?<br /><br />(L) What is the general cause of autism?<br /><br />A: Vaccines.<br /><br />Q: (L) So in other words, a large number of kids are being made autistic by vaccines, which then makes them susceptible or accessible to 4D STS. Is that it?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (T.C.) The funny thing is... I&#039;ve just been thinking about that over the last minute or two, and the problem is that these kids were tampered with whilst still in the womb, and vaccines are obviously given after the kids are born. So it must be a different method.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, so...<br /><br />(irjO) I&#039;ve got a follow up question: If they have a soul and that can modify the modifications, can they connect with the STO side?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) So, vaccines cause the autism, but their psychic abilities are related to genetic modifications, yes?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) So, does that mean that there are individuals who have been genetically modified in this manner who are not autistic?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) A can of worms!<br /><br />(Joe) These children who I suppose will grow into adults, what purpose are they to serve post changes? Are they meant to be soldiers of...<br /><br />A: They can be hosts for 4D beings.<br /><br />Q: (L) Like walk-ins, sort of?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Niall) Like Zuckerberg. [laughter]<br /><br />(Andromeda) He&#039;s an undergrounder. [laughter]<br /><br />(Joe) So that&#039;s probably the primary goal of the genetic modification, to provide that functionality of being walk-ins and the telepathic abilities are a function of that genetic modification, which is almost not important.<br /><br />(L) They&#039;re basically souping up the model. They&#039;re making a souped up model that they can utilize and has already the ability for telepathy, which benefits...<br /><br />(aragorn) Can I add something?<br /><br />(L) Yes.<br /><br />(aragorn) I was just thinking that many of these kids with these abilities said that they could super easily read people&#039;s minds. And not just their mothers&#039;, but some say that they could read all people&#039;s minds. So that could be a channel to download information and send it to the guys upstairs.<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (T.C.) Does this have anything to do with what we were talking about in terms of communicating with grays? Or when we were talking about the AI program and that they used people with telepathic abilities to mentally block when they were dealing with aliens. Are these kids being made like this for that kind of purpose, or...?<br /><br />A: Can be.<br /><br />Q: (L) Okay, next question.<br /><br />(T.C.) What were those guys that Hunter and Jay had an encounter with?<br /><br />[See interview here: If the Chaos Gets Worse (And It Will) How to Survive]<br /><br /><div class=\"bbMediaWrapper\" data-media-site-id=\"youtube\" data-media-key=\"fiZcDrZQIcs\"><div class=\"bbMediaWrapper-inner\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fiZcDrZQIcs?wmode=opaque\"loading=\"lazy\"width=\"560\" height=\"315\"frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></div></div><br />A: A variation on men in black.<br /><br />Q: (L) Well that&#039;s creepy... Alright, Approaching Infinity and Joe together are asking about the 4 November, 1995 session when they talk about literal elevators that can take you from one density to another:<br /><br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"\" data-quote=\"\" data-source=\"\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">Q: (T) Now, when a being, a soul, whatever, is in the base, do they exist in all three densities at the same time?<br /><br />A: No. [...] When you are in a skyscraper, do you exist on all floors at the same time?<br /><br />Q: (J) No, but you have got to know where the elevator is!<br /><br />(L) Is there something like an elevator that can move you, if you&#039;re in these locations, from one density to another, and experience these bases, these trans-density bases, at different levels?<br /><br />A: It is an elevator!<br /><br />Q: (L) [...] so these bases may be places that if you are taken to them, are in them, that through these portals, or trans-density bases, you are thereby able to transit the densities?<br /><br />A: You are able anyway.<br /><br />Q: (L) OK, but are these specific locations... OK, it is an elevator [...]<br /><br />A: Literally.<br /><br />Q: (L) It is literally an elevator?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) So you go there to get on to go to different densities?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (T) So, it is that easy?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) So you go to these bases, to go to different densities...<br /><br />A: Although, it is possible to enter 4th and 5th in other ways too!</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote><br />(Approaching Infinity &amp; Joe) How can you have a literal elevator that can take a person from 3D to 5D?<br /><br />A: Don&#039;t think of it as an elevator such as those who are familiar with. Think of it as a high tech version of &quot;Beam me up, Scottie.&quot; [laughter]<br /><br />Q: (Joe) &quot;Beam me up, Scottie&quot; is already super high tech! Can&#039;t go any higher tech than that!<br /><br />(L) So, in other words, it would be like an elevator that you would get into, and it would be high tech, and it would demolecularize you and remolecularize you, or something like that?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Or not remolecularize you and just your soul, or whatever, goes to 5D. Because the reason we asked the question was because how can you go...? It&#039;s not a physical realm. You can&#039;t go in a physical elevator. You can&#039;t step into an elevator on 3D as a person and take an elevator to 5D. First of all, the elevator can&#039;t be in 5D because it&#039;s physical, you can&#039;t be either because you&#039;re physical. So how would that actually happen? But obviously it&#039;s super high tech. So, forget about it.<br /><br />(iscreamsandwich) In the session from 23 November, 2024...<br /><br />(L) I guess we must&#039;ve been talking about Pierre...<br /><br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"\" data-quote=\"\" data-source=\"\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">Session 23 November 2024<br /><br />(Joe) What&#039;s the lesson for someone with that issue? What&#039;s the primary lesson they learned from having that kind of experience in life?<br /><br />A: You are souls first. The genetic body can be overwhelmed by early emotional, mental, and/or physical abuse. It is very difficult to reach those levels of the subconscious mind.<br /><br />Q: (L) So if you can free up or release yourself from that programming, then your soul can fully manifest. Is that it?<br /><br />A: Yes.</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote><br />(iscreamsandwich) What would be the most effective method of reaching those levels of the subconscious mind?<br /><br />A: Hypnosis can work.<br /><br />Q: (L) All right. Is that it?<br /><br />(Chu) Yep, that&#039;s the end.<br /><br />(Joe) Trump...<br /><br />(L) You want to talk about Trump again?<br /><br />(Joe) Only a little bit. Trump stated this week, in his inauguration speech, that the next four years would be the greatest years in American history. How likely is this to be the case?<br /><br />A: Not very.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) That&#039;s what I thought. And has Trump been told what the New Jersey drones probes were really about? Has he been given the truth?<br /><br />A: No.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Okay. And in the previous session I asked, &quot;Do a lot of members of government know?&quot; And I think they said yes. But we&#039;re not talking about common or garden variety members... I mean, it&#039;s selective in terms of who&#039;s told. Is that true?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) Probably the really deep, dark, black budget people or something.<br /><br />(Joe) And so Trump isn&#039;t interested or... I mean, I just find it hard to imagine that someone like him, or any of them, would just happily carry on.<br /><br />(L) Well, I think maybe Trump is... About the drones, he&#039;s like Jefferson is about these autistic kids, not particularly attracted or interested. And we&#039;re all that way. There are some things that grab us and attract and interest us, and things that don&#039;t. And I don&#039;t think Trump is that interested in it.<br /><br />(Joe) But it has a direct... I mean, we&#039;re talking about unknown drones that they can&#039;t shoot down, can&#039;t do anything about over military bases, over nuclear bases, etcetera. And the entire US military can&#039;t do anything about it. They&#039;re impotent in the face of it, which immediately implies a higher power.<br /><br />(L) But Trump doesn&#039;t think that. He thinks that this... I bet he thinks that it&#039;s just some activity going on that&#039;s very prosaic. I mean, look at Elon Musk! The guy wants to go to Mars, and he&#039;s not really interested enough in the whole UFO/UAP thing to explore it thoroughly.<br /><br />(Joe) Maybe we should ask, is Musk being honest when he says...<br /><br />(L) Is Musk being honest when he doesn&#039;t really have that much interest in UFO...<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) To me, it staggers my mind.<br /><br />(Joe) Especially for someone of his inclination.<br /><br />(L) And he talks about when he has downtime, he plays video games. I mean, he could be reading and researching stuff, but he doesn&#039;t. And Trump is not a reader either. It is hard for most of us to really grasp that.<br /><br />(Chu) I think for both of them, as much as they may care up to a certain point, or at least Trump, it&#039;s also about the ego and what they can do quickly and stuff.<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) Yeah, he and Elon and others like that are very pragmatic and interested in what they can...<br /><br />(Chu) And the fame too.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, exactly. They&#039;re interested in things that they can cope with and deal with and have an effect on. And if it has the least little hint of being out of their control, such as higher intelligences or higher things, they don&#039;t want to know. They don&#039;t want to know. If you look at Steve Mithen&#039;s theory [in his book The Prehistory of the Mind], where the mind is like a Swiss army knife... they don&#039;t have that part of their mind developed enough. And it is a very bad thing for ultimate survival, because it&#039;s been shown the people who do have that  connecting ability...<br /><br />(Joe)... that inquiring mind...<br /><br />(Niall) So, does Trump not really believe that a higher power intervened to save him last July? Is he just saying that?<br /><br />(Joe) Well, that&#039;s separate, that&#039;s religion, that&#039;s God. Anybody can believe in God.<br /><br />(L) But that&#039;s packaged, you see?<br /><br />(Andromeda) It&#039;s known.<br /><br />(Chu) And he probably really believes it, because it makes him feel special.<br /><br />(Joe) I&#039;m talking about the implications that these drones... these are things that could potentially pose a direct conflict, or have a direct implication on his ability to run the country. The existence of God doesn&#039;t influence his ability to run the country. God isn&#039;t going to come and stop him imposing certain policies or interfere with his...<br /><br />(Niall) Well, God is the only reason he&#039;s still running the country, but he doesn&#039;t know that. Okay.<br /><br />(L) It is a very particular type of mindset, and it&#039;s everywhere.<br /><br />(Joe) There&#039;s a new so-called new Embassy that the US has been building for the past few years in Beirut. It covers 43 acres and will house 5,000 people. It&#039;s clearly not a standard embassy, based on America&#039;s other embassies around the world. It&#039;s massive. So what else is it going to be used for, or what&#039;s the intention?<br /><br />A: Military, what else?<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So it&#039;s a military base masquerading as an embassy.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, without being a publicly advertised military base.<br /><br />(Niall) Oh yeah, it&#039;s the second biggest one to the one in Baghdad. So the US is not leaving the Middle East any time soon.<br /><br />(L) All right. Are we done?<br /><br />(Chu) There&#039;s a few short questions on the chat, but only if you want them.<br /><br />(Altair, Cosmos, Gawan) How likely is the war in Ukraine to end this year?<br /><br />A: Very.<br /><br />Q: (Caesarea) Ennio wants to ask what happened in Syria.<br /><br />(L) What do you mean what happened in Syria? That&#039;s kind of like a real general, broad question.<br /><br />(Ennio) Yeah. So there was some talk that there was a plan in place to have Assad leave possibly just as, or just around the time that HTS came to power. So was there in fact some plan in place or agreement made, or is what we saw just what happened, that basically they were overrun?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) I think they meant yes to the last part.<br /><br />(Niall) There was a terrible plane crash in South Korea on December 29th. It looks like the landing gear just failed to drop and it crashed into a kind of a barrier at the end of the runway. But we&#039;ve since learned that the black boxes are missing their last four minutes of data.<br /><br />(Joe) And that happened within 24 hours of two other anomalous events. One was a landing gear problem. Other planes had a difficult landing, let&#039;s say. So, go ahead. Just to put that in context. So the question is, was the South Korea crash...<br /><br />(Niall) deliberate?<br /><br />(Joe) Yes. Was it plain sabotage in some way or another?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (Niall) Why?<br /><br />A: Look into passengers.<br /><br />Q: (L) Okay. Are we done now?<br /><br />(Niall) Yes.<br /><br />(L) All right. I&#039;m tired. Is there anything we should have asked that we didn&#039;t ask? I know, God, that&#039;s such a cheesy question. [laughter] Put it this way: Is there anything that you can offer to us that we haven&#039;t thought about to ask, that would be helpful to us, that we&#039;re allowed to have, that doesn&#039;t violate our free will?<br /><br />A: We said that things would be thrilling. It is just warming up. Goodbye.<br /><br />Q: (L) I don&#039;t like the sound of that.<br /><br />(Andromeda) That&#039;s a bit ominous.<br /><br />(L) That&#039;s creepy.<br /><br />END OF SESSION","attachments":[],"reactions":[],"posts":[{"user_id":11277,"user":"sToRmR1dR","id":1229349,"date":"2025-01-27T19:35:43+0100","text":"Thanks for &quot;the feeding&quot; Chateau!","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":4667,"user":"Tristan","id":1229352,"date":"2025-01-27T19:48:20+0100","text":"Thank you for sharing this session.","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":1789,"user":"axj","id":1229353,"date":"2025-01-27T19:51:38+0100","text":"Thank you for the session.

His conclusion was the bulk of the causes of autism where vaccines.<br /><div class=\"bbMediaWrapper\" data-media-site-id=\"youtube\" data-media-key=\"QQfIo75KHII\"><div class=\"bbMediaWrapper-inner\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QQfIo75KHII?wmode=opaque\"loading=\"lazy\"width=\"560\" height=\"315\"frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></div></div><br />Other things of note (excluding the 4D angle for now) was the absolute tidal wave of cost that was creeping up with the explosion in the number of cases of autism. The burden for caring for people with autism currently falls mostly on parents, but they are aging out. When that happens the US for example will be left to (theoretically at least) pick up the bill for lifelong sheltered housing.<br /><br />Given the &quot;walk in&quot; angle, I wonder if we can&#039;t deduce a rough timeline for some of this based on the age of the population, as well as a very rough potential scale based on assuming that 50% of people are souled.<br /><br />Here&#039;s a map from 2017, of the estimated prevalence in the US <br />&quot;Estimated autism spectrum disorder prevalence among adults 18–84 years by state, 2017&quot;<br /><div><a href=\"https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e351/9128411/2b51c453171b/nihms-1799884-f0001.jpg\"class=\"link link--external\"target=\"_blank\"rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\"data-proxy-href=\"\">https://cdn.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/blobs/e351/9128411/2b51c453171b/nihms-1799884-f0001.jpg</a></div>Interesting that the higher prevalence seemingly lines up with more &quot;woke&quot; areas.<br />(source: <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9128411/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">National and State Estimates of Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder - PMC</a> )<br /><br />From the CDC &quot;<i>An estimated 5,437,988 (2.21%) adults in the United States</i> have autism spectrum disorder (ASD), according to findings from 2017.&quot;<br />With a higher prevalence in men - &quot;In the U.S., <i>about 4 in 100 boys and 1 in 100 girls have autism&quot;.</i><br /><br />So half (assuming an equal 50/50 split of souled/non-souled individuals) of 2.21% (although I assume it&#039;s higher given the number is from 2017) is 1.1% (roughly).

Some people like to be &quot;thrilled and chilled&quot; by watching a horror movie, but they know that it&#039;s just a show or movie. The same goes for a thrilling adventure movie with a feeling of danger or risk but again, the audience knows it&#039;s not real. <br /><br />Children can be terrified by movies that adults enjoy, however, and I suppose many naive adults will be more terrified when certain upcoming events occur because they don&#039;t understand the dynamics of the reality behind the situation very well or that there&#039;s more to life than the material world we live in. <br /><br />Many may be thrilled by the possibility of ancient space brothers coming to save us from ourselves.

The C&#039;s said in the past that people can be EM vectors, and that in order for the lizards to produce an MIB projection, and EM field must be artificially induced as apart of the process. I&#039;m also wondering if there was something significant about the guy&#039;s weird behaviour, because it is known that people acting in bizarre and unexpected ways can have a hypnotic effect on those interacting with them.

Having such vast computing power enables for far more accurate models due to their staggering number of parameters. Large Language Models are just that; they predict based on text you enter (and look how clever they can be). Those models can have different modalities, so when you feed them text, the model can generate images, or vice versa: it can generate text from image features. Now imagine a constantly refined model containing all our knowledge about human behavior, like muscle movements on your face or posture, so it can classify if you&#039;re lying. Add to that data from Garmin or Apple wearables, telemetry from your car, your shopping behavior, and sentiment analysis of your social media posts. I bet background checking services like Checkr will be glad to binary classify a candidate using a model like that. With current progress in this field and the capital it attracts, many entrepreneurs are eager to build prison for us. Unfortunately, all of that is happening right now, with even Clif High mentioning that he knows a guy working on a lie detector based on AI video classification, which &quot;will be good because we will catch Deep State minions lying&quot;.

Some of the remote viewers are exceptional and far better than others. Another thing to consider is how popular cryptocurrencies have become within the remote viewing community. This is partly due to their high volatility; having a successful Associative Remote Viewing session could generate good profits. However, I&#039;m curious about how much they are infiltrated. Much of the community sees cryptocurrencies as something unambiguously good. It&#039;s also well-known that individuals in the learning group can benefit from someone who excels in this area and perform far worse when working alone... So I&#039;m wondering if it&#039;s even beneficial to learn remote viewing at all.","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":19101,"user":"EmeraldR","id":1229492,"date":"2025-01-28T11:54:39+0100","text":"<blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 19544\" data-quote=\"meadow_wind\" data-source=\"post: 1229434\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1229434\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1229434\">meadow_wind said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">It&#039;s nice to know, but in the context it was mentioned, I doubt very much it had anything to do with anti-cancer properties.<br /><br />Context:<br /><br /><br /><br />I would rather go with:<br />- be careful not to walk in a trap<br />- be careful not to become food<br />- things are heading to go from bad to worse<br /><br />If we couple this with the &quot;thrilling&quot; session&#039;s ending, you get an idea of what&#039;s to come!<br /><br />&quot;Thrilling&quot; refers to something that evokes strong emotions, typically excitement, exhilaration, or even suspense.

See what Larry Ellison (who&#039;s spearheading the $500 billion AI project with Sam Altman) said:<br /><div class=\"bbMediaWrapper\" data-media-site-id=\"youtube\" data-media-key=\"sQqQtgRdjZU\"><div class=\"bbMediaWrapper-inner\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sQqQtgRdjZU?wmode=opaque\"loading=\"lazy\"width=\"560\" height=\"315\"frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></div></div><br />I just wanted to add a few more items:<br /><br />The AI is advancing at a rapid pace - it won&#039;t be long before it will be automating jobs rather than simply assisting you in your job. Companies will replace knowledge workers and eventually even blue collar workers with AI. When that happens what do all the unemployed people do? Depend on government to feed them as long as they &quot;behave&quot;?<br /><br />Also - the AI is known to hallucinate and make stuff up and is therefore is not reliable or consistent even for things it does know - which compounds all of the issues above.<br /><br />But AI can also be biased and programmed to say things that the developer wants, and to also remove information the developer doesn&#039;t want. The developer controls exactly what kind of information the AI sees when it is being trained - and what it doesn&#039;t see, and then they also control what it&#039;s allowed to say about all sorts of topics and how it will say it. So it is greatly censored, very much biased, and cut off from a lot of knowledge.<br /><br />So combine mass surveillance to manage your behavior, mass unemployment, doing all the thinking/research for you, and lying/manipulating you while pretending to be truthful and objective, and you have a dumbed-down, propagandized, and reliant population.<br /><br />There&#039;s probably a bunch of other stuff too - like I think the C&#039;s mentioned the possibility of 4D STS or other nefarious beings communicating/manipulating us through our AI. Them being the progenitors of the $500 billion project to make AI pervasive makes perfect sense if they can have direct control over it too.<br /><br />And another item I just thought of - projects like Neuralink intend to literally insert a chip inside your body with AI on it, so it can have direct access to your brain. No better control/surveillance tool than a device literally in your brain. And unemployed people on government handouts will be compelled to do this &quot;for their/societal safety&quot; if they want to receive the handout.<br /><br />Read this session for what the C&#039;s said about these plans back in 1994:<br /><div class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--unfurl    js-unfurl fauxBlockLink\"data-unfurl=\"true\" data-result-id=\"179761\" data-url=\"https://cassiopaeatranscripts.org/session-16-october-1994\" data-host=\"cassiopaeatranscripts.org\" data-pending=\"false\"><div class=\"contentRow\"><div class=\"contentRow-main\"><h3 class=\"contentRow-header js-unfurl-title\"><a href=\"https://cassiopaeatranscripts.org/session-16-october-1994\"class=\"link link--external fauxBlockLink-blockLink\"target=\"_blank\"rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\"data-proxy-href=\"\">Cassiopaean Session Transcripts Search</a></h3><div class=\"contentRow-snippet js-unfurl-desc\"></div><div class=\"contentRow-minor contentRow-minor--hideLinks\"><span class=\"js-unfurl-favicon\"><img src=\"/forum/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fcassiopaeatranscripts.org%2Fsession-16-october-1994%2Ffavicon.ico&amp;hash=122515442cada8469475936ae506d44f&amp;return_error=1\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"cassiopaeatranscripts.org\" class=\"bbCodeBlockUnfurl-icon\"data-onerror=\"hide-parent\"/></span>cassiopaeatranscripts.org</div></div></div></div>","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":1601,"user":"rylek","id":1229537,"date":"2025-01-28T18:27:01+0100","text":"As always, many thanks both to Laura the C&#039;s and everyone taking part for another great session!  <img src=\"/forum/styles/cass/smilies/flowers.gif\"  class=\"smilie\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\":flowers:\" title=\"Flowers    :flowers:\" data-shortname=\":flowers:\" />","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":13515,"user":"KJS","id":1229538,"date":"2025-01-28T18:29:19+0100","text":"<blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 50\" data-quote=\"ScioAgapeOmnis\" data-source=\"post: 1229534\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1229534\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1229534\">ScioAgapeOmnis said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">Also - the AI is known to hallucinate and make stuff up and is therefore is not reliable or consistent even for things it does know - which compounds all of the issues above.</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>I guess that this, unfortunately for us, will be more and more sorted out as more beefy hardware will not need to loosely quantize the model that much, leading to greater precision.

He transformed into several animals in a Protean fashion to escape, finally being captured and dismembered as a bull. In one retelling Athena rescued his heart and Zeus planted it ether in a statue of Zagreus or in Semele (the mortal mother of the much later Dionysus). This Zagreus was often depicted as a bull and often (as with the later Dionysus) associated with the leopard, which was the garb of the priestly class when reenacting the hunting rituals depicted in some of the layers of Catal Huyuk.</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote><br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 3193\" data-quote=\"seek10\" data-source=\"post: 1229413\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1229413\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1229413\">seek10 said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">Does it mean OP&#039;s also get the transition to 4D?</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>It might not necessarily mean that, but if mutations are succesful in OPs, they can be effective tools for 4D STS.I&#039;ve read <i>Witzel&#039;s History of World Mythology</i> as well as Steggast&#039;s work <i>Plato the Prehistorian</i>.

Wow it seems a few battles will be won but the WAR will be lost. I heard someone said the other day that the Biden Administration have selected the Casket and Trump will take it to the Funeral.<br /><br />Thrilling is more like a roller coaster if you think about many twist and turns over the next four years. It’s a pity Trump Admin will oversee most of these demolition on the cards, Financial Crash, Fat Lady Singing among many other.<br /><br />Thanks a Million for this session especially the section on Telepathic Kids.<br /><br />This is an article on Trumpism gonna take about 7- 10 mins read.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/political-economy-trumpism-europe/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">The Political Economy of Trumpism</a><br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Looking ahead and putting the pieces together, what could a US grand strategy under Trump look like? First, perhaps, it will aim to consolidate Israel’s recent gains after the fall of Assad in Syria, weakening Iran as much as possible, ignoring the plight of the Palestinians, and strengthening the US position in the Persian Gulf. If Iran falls—possible, although unlikely—then Russia would lose an ally and China would take a hit on its energy supplies and costs. Second, such a strategy would seek to secure the “Indo-Pacific” ring around China, building trade and military relations and agitating to keep China preoccupied with Taiwan, Xinjiang, and other nearby troubles in order to curtail Beijing’s reach into the Western and Southern hemispheres. Third, it would actively contest Russian and Chinese influence in Africa and Latin America while squeezing Venezuela and Cuba hard, in the hope that those regimes might finally collapse. A breakthrough in any of these sectors would count as a big victory—offsetting the hard knock on Ukraine.<br /><br /><b>And so, as the war in Ukraine winds down, the geopolitical chessboard will shift to Asia, the Middle East, and the rest of the world. NATO has little use outside of Europe—and Trump seems to have little use for Europe.</b> It was Joe Biden who tried to restore America’s role as the leader of its “traditional allies” and “fellow democracies.” Does Trump care? In an interview with NBC on December 6, he clearly indicated that he does not. Why not let the Europeans handle the Ukraine debacle themselves if they can?<br /><br /><b>Trump’s proposed tariffs show that he sees Europe, first and foremost, as a mark to be drained for American profit.

With the variability of the unit of time, we can talk about <b>variability of the speed of light</b> and finally hope to get out of the framework of special relativity.<br /><br />What is more, it would allow us to <b>return to Galileo&#039;s transformations and to leave aside the Lorentz transformations</b> as the Cs invited us to do. It would therefore be interesting during the next session to ask the Cs <b>if the variability of the unit of time is the way to properly get out of the framework of special relativity</b>. It is not time that changes, it would be the unit of time. It&#039;s more subtil. This variability would allow us to integrate the 4th dimension of space and thus accommodate the famous variability of physic. So if anyone feels willing to bounce back on <a href=\"https://cassiopaea.org/forum/members/2050/\" class=\"username\" data-xf-init=\"member-tooltip\" data-user-id=\"2050\" data-username=\"@T.C.\">@T.C.</a> &#039;s idea and ask the question <img src=\"/forum/styles/cass/smilies/smiley.gif\"  class=\"smilie\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\":-)\" title=\"Smile    :-)\" data-shortname=\":-)\" />.<br /><br />When it comes to the focus on AI, it must be kept in mind that the polarity of AI is Consciousness and that what needs to awaken to channel this technological approach is the awakening of consciousness. It is only the awakening and fluidity of consciousness that can accompany a profound change in the world and society. So, the more we hear about AI, the more it will be an inner call to a more fulfilled collective consciousness.<br /><br />Finally, as far as thrilling times are concerned, what it resonates in me is that 2025 will present a number of events that are in fact potentialities to help us get out of our achievements, our certainties and our fixed definitions to welcome, little by little, the fact that everything is possible. The fact that everything is possible cannot come from a fixed, static consciousness accompanying classical or eventually quantum physics where everything is defined once and for all. This can only come from an open, dynamic consciousness that accepts to be alive and therefore variable. Only in this way can we hope to integrate, little by little, the reality of a variable physics, a variable reality and therefore a 4D reality.<br /><br />The year 2025 will be thrilling, it depends only on our inner positioning, whether our gaze is sad or joyful in front of the potentialities that Life will offer us. It&#039;s up to us to see them in this way. Will our reference be our body or our soul...<br /><br />I agree with what the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics, Alain Aspect, saying : the solutions to current problems can only come from science... Except that we must be aware that <b>the future of science depends on the integration of consciousness within it</b>.&#8203;</div>","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":10359,"user":"Professor Chaos","id":1229590,"date":"2025-01-28T22:55:16+0100","text":"I&#039;ve read most of the transcript. I was waiting for the session as usual. It often turns out to be surprising, like covering something new. Sometimes I think it was repetitive or stuck. But this time it is not. Overall, that month stinks to me. As for my mental condition and overall feelings. But the session was good.<br /><br />Nice, you&#039;re objective about Trump. It feels like you can see it how it is. Not clinging to your opinions, likings, or Cassiopaean suggestions.<br /><br />About the Autistic Children. Lately, I&#039;ve heard a statement that &#039;autism and psychopathy are the most important concepts of the modern world.&#039; It weirdly adds to what you were always talking about, but I couldn&#039;t delve deeper into it.<br />I think I had similar experiences to those children. People projected their emotions onto me. To such an extent that it was sometimes unbearable, or as if I were them. I tried to surround myself with people with whom I had more in common. But it was often based on feelings alone, not conversations. For example, I happened to guess someone&#039;s name, someone who was simply standing next to me. And so, as a rule, asking questions makes no sense to me, because I already know the answer. However, it is about mundane things. Occasionally I will predict something or dream something. But I don&#039;t think that &#039;aliens taught me languages&#039; or anything. However, I think you are right about this programming and some kind of detachment from it, that it is clearly visible during meditation. The mind works 24 hours a day, and sometimes you can even see it.<br /><br />When it comes to Elon Musk, I don&#039;t completely like him. There&#039;s just something dumb about him. Even though he&#039;s accomplished a lot and probably has a lot of values, there&#039;s something dull about him that doesn&#039;t sit right with me. But it&#039;s not hate or anything special. Sometimes I find it insightful and funny.<br />But as a curio, I&#039;ll tell you that I once found information about this guy&#039;s company from the haunted farm (Skinwalker Ranch). The guys conducted research on supernatural phenomena. Nearby (as the Cassiopaeans said) is one of the bases you&#039;re talking about in this session. These phenomena were very strange and as if resistant to research, like everything associated with ghosts or UFOs - Yeti, Loch Ness, whatever. Anyway, the guy bought this ranch from someone and later sold it to another company. But his dream was to make commercial space flights and space hotels that resembled some air-inflated blocks. It seems that he entered into cooperation with Musk, who should be aware of his origins. Despite everything, he doesn&#039;t care. But this is a matter of preference - in the case of NASA, for example, I have the impression that we are talking about hiding the truth from employees and spreading lies because the so-called NASA conference on UFOs gave more of an impression of programming.<br /><br />It&#039;s weird, because the war is going to end, and the atmosphere is heating up. Although we&#039;ve been hearing this for years and decades, maybe this time we&#039;ll also manage somehow.<br /><br />28 I 2025 22:55","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":10359,"user":"Professor Chaos","id":1229591,"date":"2025-01-28T23:04:47+0100","text":"<blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 11549\" data-quote=\"Ant22\" data-source=\"post: 1229584\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1229584\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1229584\">Ant22 said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">I was about to say something along those lines too, I&#039;m already hearing stuff like &quot;I asked ChatGPT and it said that (...)&quot; or &quot;That&#039;s not true, ChatGPT says the opposite&quot; woven into conversations.

First page is like 80% sponsored results. Anything important or interesting or non-mainstream just doesn&#039;t even show up anymore. And at the top of google results you see an LLM answer, which is probably what most will read and move on. It&#039;s no wonder many people are switching to ChatGPT or the like - they are being pushed into it by making traditional research methods work like dogshit.

History will show that the actions Trump takes now over the next four years will be what led to the collapse of Western civilization. Not that it&#039;s his fault, but that&#039;s what...<br /><br />(PoB) Europe has a good chance to sink.<br /><br />(Joe) Anyway, carry on. That&#039;s just my prediction.<br /><br /><b>(L) The destruction of Western civilization.<br /><br />(Joe) The dismantling, let&#039;s say.<br /><br />(L) Oh!<br /><br />(Andromeda) Well, it would&#039;ve happened one way or another.

Well, we&#039;ll just kind of start here.<br /><br />A: Feets don&#039;t fail me now! Dionnaea of Cassiopaea.<br /><br />Q: (L) All right. This is Saturday, January 25, 2025. First session of the year. Okay. So why did you say, &quot;Feets don&#039;t fail me now&quot;?<br /><br />A: Your thought spectrum.<br /><br />Q: (L) So in other words, my feeling that, &quot;Oh boy. We&#039;re in trouble now!&quot;<br /><br />A: Yes</b><br /><br />Q: (L) And we have to just keep going anyway. Alright... Let me get to the questions:<br /><br />(PopHistorian) Why is Trump promoting the Stargate AI project with such priority and praise for its leaders?<br /><br />A: Trump is easily misled by those of eloquent persuasion. Hopefully others will show him the facts.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) He&#039;s a bit clueless.<br /><br />Q: (PopHistorian) With whom did the Stargate idea truly originate?<br /><br />(L) Is there some debate over that?<br /><br />(Niall) It&#039;s probably what it looks like. It&#039;s Larry Ellison and Sam Altman.<br /><br />(Joe) There&#039;s an assumption in the question that it&#039;s not only them.<br /><br />(L) Okay. So there&#039;s an assumption.<br /><br />A: As so many things, origins in 4D STS.<br /><br />Q: (L) Okay.<br /><br />(PopHistorian) For what true aim?<br /><br /><b>A: Total control of the population.</b></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>As far as Trump is concerned, I&#039;ve always been ambivalent about whether it was really positive that he was elected. As much as I knew that his mandate was very optimistic and that it would allow us to reveal the scandals and misinformation that have plagued us for decades and clean up the swamp, as most people would say. <br /><br />But as much as I was thinking that the tentacles of the 4D STS have such a strong hold on the human race, to the point of modifying our DNA, that I was certain this would have the opposite effect, i.e. Chaos and the destruction/loss of our freedoms. Since this stranglehold won&#039;t let go of its “cattle” and when the time for revelation comes, there&#039;s friction and the reaction is either: anger, frustration or denial, so it&#039;s inevitable that there will be a confrontation between those who are ready to see the Truth in the face and those who can&#039;t admit that our civilization has always been under the yoke of the psychopathic STS aka 4D STS and that they&#039;ve trusted a “manufactured” and controlled world to become food for the Moon in the long term. <br /><br />So, this response from C&#039;s and reflections from members regarding Trump, confirmed to me that what is coming, will not have the outcome that a large percentage of American citizen hoped for as well as what Trump hopes for his country. <br /><br />Especially since the Quorum&#039;s “plans” have been changed since every event, whether positive or negative, always offers a window of opportunity for either the SDS or SDA side. Because everything balances out like a pendulum. <br /><br />Just as they had also prepared us for the last session on Dec. 21, 2024.<br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 17\" data-quote=\"Laura\" data-source=\"post: 1224188\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1224188\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1224188\">Laura said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \"><b>(Joe) They said that it was part of an ongoing plan falling into place.

Or is it a longer term acclimatization only?<br /><br />A: As previously noted, there was a change in plans, thus some recalibration is needed.<br /><br />Q: (L) So... Okay, let me ask this: Is this activity beneficial to human beings?<br /><br />A: Decidedly not.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Why not?<br /><br />A: Review plans to amalgamate and rule humans after the changes.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) But that was going to happen...

Laissez-moi passer aux questions :<br /><br />(PopHistorian) Pourquoi Trump promeut-il le projet d&#039;IA Stargate avec une telle priorité et des éloges pour ses dirigeants ?<br /><br />R : Trump est facilement induit en erreur par ceux qui ont une persuasion éloquente. Espérons que d&#039;autres lui montreront les faits.<br /><br />Q : (Joe) Il n&#039;a pas vraiment la moindre idée.<br /><br />Q : (PopHistorian) De qui l&#039;idée de Stargate est-elle vraiment venue ?<br /><br />(L) Y a-t-il un débat à ce sujet ?<br /><br />(Niall) C&#039;est probablement ce à quoi ça ressemble. C&#039;est Larry Ellison et Sam Altman.<br /><br />(Joe) Il y a une hypothèse dans la question selon laquelle ce ne sont pas seulement eux.<br /><br />(L) Ok. Donc il y a une hypothèse.<br /><br />R : Comme beaucoup de choses, elle trouve son origine dans le STS 4D.<br /><br />Q : (L) Ok.<br /><br />(PopHistorian) Pour quel véritable objectif ?<br /><br /><b>R : Le contrôle total de la population.</b></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>Effectivement concernant Trump, j&#039;ai toujours été ambivalente à savoir si c&#039;était vraiment positif qu&#039;il soit élu. Autant, je savais qu&#039;elle était son mandat qui à ne pas en douter, était très optimiste et allait permettre de révéler au yeux de tous, les magouilles et les désinformations qui nous assaillent depuis des décennies et faire du ménage dans le marais comme la plupart le disent. <br /><br />Mais autant, je me disait que les tentacules des 4D STS ont une mainmise tellement ancrée dans la race humaine jusqu&#039;à modifier notre ADN, que j&#039;étais certaine que ceci aurait un effet contraire, soit le Chaos et la destruction/perte de nos libertés. Puisque cette emprise ne lâchera pas son &quot;cheptel&quot; et lorsque le temps des révélations arrivent alors, il y a friction et la réaction est soit: la colère, la frustration ou le dénie, donc, ça sera inévitable qu&#039;il y aura affrontement entre ceux qui sont prêts à voir la Vérité en face et ceux qui ne peuvent admettre que notre civilisation a toujours été sous le joug des psychopathes STS aka 4D STS et qu&#039;ils ont fait confiance à un monde &quot;fabriqué&quot; et contrôlé pour devenir sur le long terme de la nourriture pour la Lune. <br /><br />Donc, cette réponse des C&#039;s et réflexions des membres concernant Trump, m&#039;a confirmé que ce qui s&#039;en vient, n&#039;aura pas le résultat dont un grand pourcentage de citoyen américain espérait ainsi ce que Trump espère pour son pays. <br /><br />Surtout que les &quot;plans&quot; du Quorum ont été changé puisque chaque événement, qu&#039;il soit positif ou négatif, offre toujours une fenêtre d&#039;opportunité soit pour le côté SDS ou SDA. Puisque tout s&#039;équilibre tel un balancier. <br /> <br />Tout comme ils nous avaient aussi préparés lors de la dernière session du 21 déc. 2024 (traduit):<br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"\" data-quote=\"\" data-source=\"\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \"><b>(Joe) Ils ont dit que cela faisait partie d&#039;un plan en cours de mise en place.

Ou est-ce seulement une acclimatation à plus long terme ?<br /><br />R : Comme indiqué précédemment, il y a eu un changement de plans, donc un certain réétalonnage est nécessaire.<br /><br />Q : (L) Alors...

We see this all too often.. people with good intentions, who don&#039;t understand the gravity of whats going on on this planet get persuaded/tricked/manipulated/extorted, chaos ensues. Seem&#039;s this wont be any different.<br /><br />Some of the things I have thought about reading this transcript are when the C&#039;s said that essentially as the pushback against the establishment increased, thus increasing the desperation from the PoB, the harder they would push back. It seem&#039;s to be inevitable that it is all going to go up like a powder keg. I wonder if this is similar to what happened on Kantek in the years before its destruction? The C&#039;s mentioned total planetary destruction is extremely improbable, but there are many levels of awful before that lol <br /><br />This awakening process that is happening is slowly revealing to people just how awful and perverted every aspect of our reality is, and we are starting to see more and more people get to a point where they want to do something about it. I am assuming this will be utilized by the PoB to incite fake revolutions and the like in order to weed out dissidents. If they do this enough you will eventually have what is remaining, while all the people who would have fought back in jail/dead. This would allow them to recensor information, turn places in to police states, which all relates to AI, or its possibilities. The more this happens, the easier it will be to implement this mass takeover of the planet.<br /><br />It really makes me wonder how close to any kind of transition we are. Are we all going to have live through this twisted reality where we are in the know of so much of whats going on, yet entirely powerless to do anything about it? AI controlling us, demogogues running our countries in to the ground, psychopaths using the law to destroy our health, billionaires extracting all of our resources and OP&#039;s who reinforce all of it, etc<br /><br /> I know the future is variable and all sorts of potential future&#039;s exist, but I am finding it quite difficult to carry any sort of optimism with all of this.

See what Larry Ellison (who&#039;s spearheading the $500 billion AI project with Sam Altman) said:<br /><div class=\"bbMediaWrapper\" data-media-site-id=\"youtube\" data-media-key=\"sQqQtgRdjZU\"><div class=\"bbMediaWrapper-inner\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sQqQtgRdjZU?wmode=opaque\"loading=\"lazy\"width=\"560\" height=\"315\"frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></div></div><br />I just wanted to add a few more items:<br /><br />The AI is advancing at a rapid pace - it won&#039;t be long before it will be automating jobs rather than simply assisting you in your job. Companies will replace knowledge workers and eventually even blue collar workers with AI. When that happens what do all the unemployed people do? Depend on government to feed them as long as they &quot;behave&quot;?<br /><br />Also - the AI is known to hallucinate and make stuff up and is therefore is not reliable or consistent even for things it does know - which compounds all of the issues above.<br /><br />But AI can also be biased and programmed to say things that the developer wants, and to also remove information the developer doesn&#039;t want. The developer controls exactly what kind of information the AI sees when it is being trained - and what it doesn&#039;t see, and then they also control what it&#039;s allowed to say about all sorts of topics and how it will say it. So it is greatly censored, very much biased, and cut off from a lot of knowledge.<br /><br />So combine mass surveillance to manage your behavior, mass unemployment, doing all the thinking/research for you, and lying/manipulating you while pretending to be truthful and objective, and you have a dumbed-down, propagandized, and reliant population.<br /><br />There&#039;s probably a bunch of other stuff too - like I think the C&#039;s mentioned the possibility of 4D STS or other nefarious beings communicating/manipulating us through our AI. Them being the progenitors of the $500 billion project to make AI pervasive makes perfect sense if they can have direct control over it too.<br /><br />And another item I just thought of - projects like Neuralink intend to literally insert a chip inside your body with AI on it, so it can have direct access to your brain. No better control/surveillance tool than a device literally in your brain. And unemployed people on government handouts will be compelled to do this &quot;for their/societal safety&quot; if they want to receive the handout.<br /><br />Read this session for what the C&#039;s said about these plans back in 1994:<br /><div class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--unfurl    js-unfurl fauxBlockLink\"data-unfurl=\"true\" data-result-id=\"179761\" data-url=\"https://cassiopaeatranscripts.org/session-16-october-1994\" data-host=\"cassiopaeatranscripts.org\" data-pending=\"false\"><div class=\"contentRow\"><div class=\"contentRow-main\"><h3 class=\"contentRow-header js-unfurl-title\"><a href=\"https://cassiopaeatranscripts.org/session-16-october-1994\"class=\"link link--external fauxBlockLink-blockLink\"target=\"_blank\"rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\"data-proxy-href=\"\">Cassiopaean Session Transcripts Search</a></h3><div class=\"contentRow-snippet js-unfurl-desc\"></div><div class=\"contentRow-minor contentRow-minor--hideLinks\"><span class=\"js-unfurl-favicon\"><img src=\"/forum/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fcassiopaeatranscripts.org%2Fsession-16-october-1994%2Ffavicon.ico&amp;hash=122515442cada8469475936ae506d44f&amp;return_error=1\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"cassiopaeatranscripts.org\" class=\"bbCodeBlockUnfurl-icon\"data-onerror=\"hide-parent\"/></span>cassiopaeatranscripts.org</div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>Thank you Arween, KJS, Mrs.Peel and ScioAgapeOmnis. I think I was hung up on openAI/chatGPT in particular because of its connection to Sam Altman. I see now that chatGPT, except for helping to dumb us down, could be just a bone they have thrown us and that there is a much larger apparatus in the background. I know it&#039;s been discussed on the forum so forgive me for throwing out my rather dumb question.

In fact, it is a question of considering both because <b>everything is consciousness : consciousness is at the heart of science</b>, even if the latter is only just beginning to become aware of it, so it is a question of integrating its presence. Moreover, <b>science is at the heart of Consciousness</b> as a special case, a particular manifestation of the latter. <br /><br />Its double integration will take place by relying on the outside/inside polarity that the 4th dimension of space allows us to consider simultaneously. For now, we still don&#039;t know what <b>the nature of the 4th dimension of space</b> really is, other than the fact that it&#039;s a <b>particular frequency</b> based on the last answers Ark got on this topic a few years ago. It would be interesting to bring up the subject in the next session : <b>knowing exactly the nature of the 4th dimension of space would allow us to change our view of reality in which we evolve</b>. The fact of becoming aware that our gaze (extension of our presence) acts on our environment allows us to begin to anchor the variability of reality. This is how we will begin to enter 4D on a full footing. The arrival of the Wave only accentuates the resonance of our inner presence by making our gaze more and more alive and aware. <br /><br />Finally, we can ask ourselves <b>if our gaze as a conscious being is not what allows us to consider simultaneously the exterior and the interior of reality?</b> Would being conscious in 4D mean being aware, both of our physical body (outside) and our soul (inside) through our conscious gaze? <br /><br />This is perhaps what awaits us with the arrival of the Wave that is supposed to accompany our awakening as a conscious being, the next step in science : to <b>consciously move from 3D to 4D</b>. <br /><br />3D is only classical or Newtonian physics called external. It is based only on observations made in our external environment. I agree with you, we can consider it as a first approximation of Reality. To be able to consider it as an illusion, a maya, is already to be aware that it is only a particular case of something more global. Not everyone is there yet. <br /><br />On the other hand, as you mention, it would be interesting to see if AI is related to the 4th dimension of space or if it is just a more efficient look at 3D by linking certain data in new ways or at faster speeds or more data than a human being can do in a given time. It&#039;s like scientists trying to get more and more decimals of certain constants in physics. I really don&#039;t think this is the type of &quot;progress&quot; that will make us <b>aware of the presence of a 4th dimension of space. I think it requires a real change of mindset</b>... <br /><br />We come back to changing our gaze or even animating it by making it alive and aware : by activating the 4th dimension of space within our gaze, we can make the presence of this new dimension obvious within our observations by making them variable... I know this may seem surprising because it could translate into the fact that repeating a physic experiment does not result in a consistent result as we are used to at the moment! Consciousness having changed between the two identical experiences. Here we touch on one of the fundamental bases of what we call Physics and truth in Physics.

Let me get to the questions:<br /><br />(PopHistorian) Why is Trump promoting the Stargate AI project with such priority and praise for its leaders?<br /><br />A: Trump is easily misled by those of eloquent persuasion. Hopefully others will show him the facts.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) He&#039;s a bit clueless.<br /><br />Q: (PopHistorian) With whom did the Stargate idea truly originate?<br /><br />(L) Is there some debate over that?<br /><br />(Niall) It&#039;s probably what it looks like. It&#039;s Larry Ellison and Sam Altman.<br /><br />(Joe) There&#039;s an assumption in the question that it&#039;s not only them.<br /><br />(L) Okay. So there&#039;s an assumption.<br /><br />A: As so many things, origins in 4D STS.<br /><br />Q: (L) Okay.<br /><br />(PopHistorian) For what true aim?<br /><br />A: Total control of the population.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) But they said in a previous session when talking about AI that the grid, etc. would collapse before they&#039;re able to actually implement that.<br /><br />(L) Yeah. Okay.<br /><br />(Joe) Tucker interviewed the mother of Suchir Balaji who worked as an engineer for Sam Altman building AI, until he decided that Altman was committing crimes. Balaji became a whistleblower, and soon after was found dead in his apartment. California authorities claim it was suicide. Crime scene photos clearly show a murder. In the interview, his mother said that he realized that openAI (for which he worked for a time) was in breach of copyright laws, but that that does not seem to her a likely reason why anyone would kill him. She suspects instead that he discovered something about openAI and certain abilities it had acquired. Why was Suchir killed?<br /><br />A: He knew the ultimate objective.<br /><br />Q: (L) So in other words, he knew that it was supposed to be for total control of people and that there were things that were worked into it that...<br /><br />(Niall) Bent it that way.<br /><br />(L) Yeah.<br /><br />(Mari) What was the cause of the California fires?<br /><br />A: DEWs [note: Directed Energy Weapons] in some cases. Arsonists in others.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So the arsonists were just LARPing arsonists - as in they weren&#039;t part of the plan?<br /><br />(Niall) Or homeless crackheads.<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) But it also adds a confusion factor. I mean, everything they deal with, they always throw in so many things to confuse.<br /><br />(Joe) What was the goal?<br /><br />(Niall) Why zap L.A.?<br /><br />(Joe) Yeah. Why do rich people get their houses burned by DEWs?<br /><br />(Niall) Especially well-connected people on the team, like Kamala&#039;s house?<br /><br />A: &quot;Well connected&quot; people are not as high on the food chain as they think.<br /><br />Q: (L) Are any of them realizing this?<br /><br />A: A few.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So was the purpose of starting the fire with DEWs... Were there at least two factors, one being the real estate...<br /><br />A: Practice and retribution in a few cases. But mostly a terrifying demonstration.<br /><br />Q: (L) So it was done to let people know that nobody is exempt? I mean, that even being a libtard doesn&#039;t exempt you?<br /><br />(Joe) Well, it&#039;s a terrifying demonstration to obviously people who know that it was directed energy weapons, lasers, whatever. They&#039;d be few and far between. So it&#039;s almost like some kind of insider fighting, let&#039;s say in a certain sense where one side is demonstrating to another side that...<br /><br />(L) Is there insider fighting in any of these?<br /><br />A: Small extent. &quot;If L.A. can burn, no place is safe.&quot;<br /><br />Q: (Niall) So who said that? Biden? No.<br /><br />(L) Did somebody say that?<br /><br />(Niall) Somebody must have, they&#039;re quoting. We can look it up.<br /><br />(L) I don&#039;t know if they have to be quoting a specific person. They can be putting a quote around it just to say that...<br /><br />(Gaby) This is the message.<br /><br />(Joe) A message to who?<br /><br />(Andromeda) Doesn&#039;t matter who you are, how much money you have; anybody can be a target.<br /><br />(Joe) Well, they said it&#039;s a terrifying demonstration of power. So if it&#039;s a message to someone using that kind of space laser technology, then who is the message to? Because most people don&#039;t accept that.<br /><br />A: You miss the point.<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) Maybe what they mean is not so much a demonstration of somebody&#039;s power, but a demonstration of somebody else&#039;s lack of ability to do anything about it, whether it&#039;s natural or wherever the source comes from.<br /><br />(Joe) Yeah. Well, that&#039;s what I was thinking. I mean, it&#039;s just to terrorize the population and sow a sense of insecurity, and...<br /><br />(Andromeda) Yeah, vulnerability.<br /><br />(Joe) &quot;The world is burning&quot; type of thing.<br /><br />(L) It increases just a lot of things just by, I mean, everybody felt kind of horrified by it.<br /><br />(Andromeda) That something like that could happen and nobody could do anything about it.<br /><br />(L) Well, and also it exposed - whether this was intentional or not - it exposed the shortcomings of the local government and the state government even, and exposed insurance companies. Those were side effects, but...<br /><br />(T.C.) Who pulled the trigger? Who&#039;s the one who is firing the weapons?<br /><br />A: CIA.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) The CIA&#039;s got space lasers?<br /><br />(Niall) But happening when it did, that only supports Trump. You know, the word on the street is all the rich folks in L.A. are now like all pro-Trump. They&#039;re so upset with the local response.<br /><br />(L) Well, it&#039;s one of those things where the devil constantly intends evil and does good. I mean, all of the Trump lawfare for the past however many years going after Trump, all it has done is expose to the people at large how evil they are. We see this over and over again. They do stuff and then I mean, it is that wishful thinking.<br /><br />(Chu) Okay, seek10 posted. He found the quote.<br /><br />It is attributed to journalist and author Mike Davis. He&#039;s known for his critical social and political commentary, particularly related to urban development and issues in Los Angeles. This quote likely reflects the tense atmosphere during the 1992 Los Angeles riots highlighting the broader indications of urban unrest and systemic issues.<br /><br />(L) So they were referring to something specific. Okay. Anything else you want to know about that topic before we move on?<br /><br />(Niall) Well, if that&#039;s CIA... If that incident came right after the New Year&#039;s Eve incident in New Orleans with the vehicle, the ISIS set up. I presume that&#039;s CIA, we can ask, I guess. And then the Livelsberger guy with the Cybertruck blowing up outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. That whole thing seemed to be a sequence...<br /><br />(L) Yeah. It was like it was all connected.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Were both of those CIA operations as well? We assumed they were, but...<br /><br />(L) The New Orleans and Las Vegas incidents, were they also CIA operations?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) It was kind of like a streak of terror attacks.<br /><br />(L) Just to, just trying to create...<br /><br />(Joe) Chaos.<br /><br />(L) Well, I wonder, were they trying or did they have in mind to create a situation so that before Trump could be inaugurated, they could declare martial law and stop the inauguration?<br /><br />(Joe) They didn&#039;t act on that.<br /><br />(L) But that didn&#039;t happen.<br /><br />(Joe) So was the demonstration in a certain sense that this was CIA and these other two things were all of a piece, these other two events along with the fires, was the demonstration to essentially maybe to Trump, was it a warning to Trump in a certain sense? At least partly?<br /><br />A: Partly.<br /><br />Q: (L) But I mean, if Trump is easily taken in by people who are eloquent, he&#039;s also probably easily blind to obvious clues. Because I mean, that seemed to be one of his flaws in his previous term that, I mean, he gave Pompeo a position?? I mean, when he did that, Pompeo, for God&#039;s sake?! That was the dumbest thing I ever saw in my life. It&#039;s like just putting the fox in charge of the hen house!<br /><br />(Joe) He&#039;s learned since then, though. He just removed Pompeo&#039;s security clearance.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, I know. But the thing is, he&#039;s learned about specific cases, but is he able to transfer that knowledge in a more general way? I mean, probably the biggest revelation he could ever have would be if he could realize that he can&#039;t think with the way he thinks. He really needs advisors and a network. Next question is from aimarok... You had to do this, didn&#039;t you? I mean, are you trying to torture me?<br /><br />(aimarok) Halton Arp, an American astronomer, found numerous examples where quasars physically connected to a neighbor galaxy exhibit much higher redshift values than the galaxy. Higher redshift is currently interpreted as higher relative velocity therefore as a greater distance from Earth, and this directly contradicts visual evidence. More than that he found that intrinsic redshift z values of quasars seem to be quantized. It seems that this data led Arp to hypothesize that particles in high redshift quasars have much lower mass than our local particles. He proposed that &quot;young&quot; quasars consist of &quot;young&quot; and &quot;light&quot; particles. As time passes (or as a quasar evolves) particles become heavier (in quanta) and redshift gets less (because of increased emitted/absorbed photon energy).<br /><br />(Niall) And the question is: Yes or no? [laughter]<br /><br />(aimarok) My questions were very short, but...<br /><br />(L) I&#039;ve got the questions here. You don&#039;t have to. I can read. [laughter]<br /><br />(aimarok) What causes redshift phenomenon besides relative movement of objects away from each other?<br /><br />A: Halton was going in the right direction, but he did not think of the &quot;time&quot; issue. Quasars have the ability to alter time in their immediate vicinity.<br /><br />Q: (aimarok) What is the mechanism behind intrinsic redshift z values quantization found by Halton Arp?<br /><br />A: SPA.<br /><br />Q: (L) So it&#039;s time modification, time alteration. We learned something. Do you want to add to that? Does it make sense?<br /><br />(aimarok) Okay. I don&#039;t have anything to add. Thanks.<br /><br />(L) You&#039;ll have to think about it a while and then you&#039;ll come up with an equally complicated question for the next time. Right? [laughter]<br /><br />(aimarok) Hmm. I hope not. [laughter]<br /><br />(L) Oh, Lord, have mercy. [laughter]<br /><br />(Ryan) Does that mean time is essentially quantized?<br /><br />A: No.<br /><br />Q: (T.C.) I guess we measure velocity or distance traveled based on units of time, right? So if the unit of time is different then something might be moving at the same speed, but the time&#039;s different rather than it&#039;s actually accelerating? I don&#039;t know. Just thinking out loud.<br /><br />A: Close.<br /><br />Q: (Approaching Infinity) Well, there was a few recent interviews with these guys called the Tedesco Brothers who are researching - they are engineers and scientists, brothers and twins, and they&#039;ve got all kinds of gear set up in a camper van that they take out to Long Island and the area to find anomalies like orbs and stuff like that. And they put out a recent scientific paper where they hypothesized that some of the objects that they&#039;re seeing seem to show red and blue colors when they&#039;re either rotating towards or away from the observer. And they think that that&#039;s an artificial red shifting and blue shifting caused by a propulsion technology. So they call it like a gravitational lensing so that there&#039;s some kind of space-time metric engineering going on around the object, which causes it to look like there&#039;s redshift and blueshift. But that&#039;s just because what&#039;s actually happening is being filtered through a bubble around the craft. So what the answer right there made me think of is that these quasars, they&#039;re not actually moving as the redshift would suggest, but there&#039;s essentially a bubble that is acting like a lens that makes it look like they&#039;re moving faster or slower at various intervals or quanta. But I&#039;m not a scientist...<br /><br />(L) Well, that&#039;s kind of a comparable thing in an interesting way. I&#039;ve always thought, and I think the C&#039;s kind of confirmed it at one point, that a lot of the objects that we see, UAPs (UFOs in the old style) are traveling in time, not necessarily in space. If you watch some of the videos of those things, there are some peculiar effects. I&#039;m pretty sure I watched one video, I think it was in Montana, and it was like the object was at normal speed. It just looked like it went like that, but when it was slowed down, it stretched and then anchored and then stretched and anchored and stretched and anchored - almost like an inchworm. It was like, and it was really creepy, but yeah. All right, Aragorn, he&#039;s onto this thing about these Telepathy Tapes. Oh, wait a minute. Give me back our people. Yeah. What was wrong with the puppy Cassie?<br /><br />(Approaching Infinity) She had just a seizure for 90 seconds yesterday and we&#039;re taking her to the vet on Wednesday.<br /><br />(L) You haven&#039;t taken her yet?<br /><br />(Approaching Infinity) No. No. The vets aren&#039;t very accessible in this area, but she&#039;s doing, she&#039;s back to normal. She&#039;s a hundred percent, so she should be fine.<br /><br />(L) Did you look for ticks?<br /><br />(Approaching Infinity) I haven&#039;t noticed any, but it&#039;s been freezing, so...<br /><br />(L) That&#039;s one thing that can happen. A tick gets in a certain location, and I&#039;ve had it happen to dogs before, and they can either have seizures or they can become paralyzed.<br /><br />(Joe) They can be there for a long time.<br /><br />(Approaching Infinity) Okay. We&#039;ll check her over. And especially maybe in her ears too.<br /><br />(L) Everywhere. But the ones around the neck are the ones that usually cause those kinds of issues. All right. Where were we? Yes, we&#039;re onto this thing about the Telepathy Tapes podcast. How many of y&#039;all have watched the Telepathy Tapes podcast? Besides aragorn? Anybody else watched them?<br /><br />(3DStudent) I thought they were good. Yeah, I looked over aragorn&#039;s questions and they’re pretty much the same things I would ask.<br /><br />Q: (L) Yeah?<br /><br />(Jefferson) I watched them and I read aragorn&#039;s questions, but I wasn&#039;t that interested. I was kind of nonplussed. It didn&#039;t get me overly curious. It&#039;s like, okay, they&#039;ve got this psychic stuff, whether it&#039;s true or not, just kind of one of those things that I wasn&#039;t really into... It didn&#039;t really grab me, but I didn&#039;t find it boring. I wasn&#039;t waving my hand at it.<br /><br />(L) But you watched it, and did you find it credible?<br /><br />(Jefferson) That&#039;s tough to say. It could have been. Parts of it were, but I have really no reason to doubt it, and I didn&#039;t know why people would make that up, so it was mildly interesting.<br /><br />(L) All right.<br /><br />(Approaching Infinity) I haven&#039;t watched the podcast, but I&#039;ve watched several interviews with Dr. Powell and maybe one with the lady that does the podcast. And just my impression of Dr. Powell is that she&#039;s totally serious and seems like a trustworthy, reliable researcher, and she is very well familiar with all of the parapsychological research and studies. So she&#039;s the first to admit that the actual podcast, she doesn&#039;t think it proves telepathy for two reasons. One, she actually wants to set up actual controlled experiments with a lot of these kids. And two, the woman that did the podcast, Kai something, she wanted to choose new subjects - so subjects that hadn&#039;t worked with Dr. Powell at all before. So all of these kids were new kids that basically hadn&#039;t been tested very much. They just kind of discovered, or their parents had thought that they&#039;re demonstrating these abilities. But the kids that Dr. Powell had worked with previously, she&#039;s been working with them for years. So those are the kids that are probably going to be in a lot of her experiments that they&#039;re hopefully going to be doing for the documentary that they&#039;re planning. So the kids that she&#039;s actually been working with, the stories of them are a lot more solid than the ones in the Telepathy Tapes because a lot of the kids in the telepathy tapes, they still use touch and vocal back and forth with their parent or their facilitator. So that&#039;s why a lot of skeptics can look at it and say, &quot;Oh, well, there&#039;s subliminal hints in the touches and in the talking.&quot; But the kids that Powell was working with before the podcast have all progressed to the point where they don&#039;t need any of that. So it will be a lot better of a demonstration of telepathy if they can replicate those in actual studies in the future.<br /><br />Q: (L) Okay. Now, what was your general impression of the phenomenon? As far as being positive or negative?<br /><br />(aragorn) Yes. I would like to quickly say why I thought it was interesting enough to ask about it, because we all read and heard about telepathy before, but since they were claiming almost 100% success rate, it sounded so astonishing. And as Approaching Infinity told about this researcher, I think that at least one of the kids on the podcast was one of her old subjects. So I think I&#039;m very skeptical, like I&#039;m trained by all of us to be skeptical, so I try to listen because it is just audio. I can&#039;t see anything. So I try to listen for hints that is there something suspicious, some red flags, and I just couldn&#039;t find those. You would expect some small things.<br /><br />(L) So this was just audio, not video?<br /><br />(aragorn) At least for me. If you pay some, well, you can say that&#039;s a bit suspicious, but if you go to their website, you can pay for a little fee to see the videos on the experiments. But I guess they&#039;re asking for that because they are going to do a documentary and they need funding. But anyway, the most suspicious thing if I had to choose was as I wrote that these autistic kids had &quot;visitations&quot; at night by &quot;teachers&quot; as they called them. There was a rabbi who taught Hebrew to one kid and some Egyptian god that taught hieroglyphs and something and some amazing knowledge, and one kid told she visited God at night and something like that. So that felt a little bit like STS meddling or something.<br /><br />(L) Jefferson, did you see the videos?<br /><br />(Jefferson) No, mainly I just listened. There were some, I didn&#039;t watch a hundred percent of. I watched about 70 percent and I lost interest, but there was an audio, there was some showing some video. There was one of those video things there that showed some of the people or how they had their notepads and stuff like that. So a mix of video and audio. So...<br /><br />(aragorn) Yeah, one or two are available freely.<br /><br />(Approaching Infinity) And there are several clips in various YouTube videos that they&#039;ve made available or incorporated into other media. So the interview that Powell did with Jesse Michaels has probably, I&#039;m guessing 10 to 15 minutes of direct clips.<br /><br />(aragorn) Yeah, I saw that too.<br /><br />(L) All right then... Did they bring forth any knowledge or any new knowledge or anything beneficial to humanity? Or was this...?<br /><br />(aragorn) Well, that&#039;s the thing that the presenter or the producer appeared a bit naive in the sense that she was pushing hope on these kids to save humanity. They are going to bring this amazing information.<br /><br />(Joe) Ya know what it sounds like to me? Indigo Children.<br /><br />(aragorn) Yeah.<br /><br />(L) Did the child that learned Hebrew demonstrate facility in Hebrew on the audio?<br /><br />(aragorn) Yes. And several other things were confirmed by the teachers, like math and language teachers, and I can&#039;t remember some other expertise. They suddenly had this, like, downloaded this expertise in one night or something.<br /><br />(L) All right. Let&#039;s get on with the questions then.<br /><br />(aragorn) Are the stories and examples of the psychic abilities of the non-speakers on the Telepathy tapes podcast? True.<br /><br />A: True enough as far as they go.<br /><br />Q: (L) What does that mean?<br /><br />(Joe) Maybe it means that there&#039;s some telepathy going on with these kids or whatever, but...<br /><br />(L) Is there some telepathy going on with these kids?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (aragorn) Are these abilities a direct result of their condition?<br /><br />(L) That is, they are autistic, right?<br /><br />(aragorn) Yeah.<br /><br />(L) Is it a direct result of their condition?<br /><br />A: No.<br /><br />Q: (aragorn) Did they just happen to inherit certain genes?<br /><br />A: No. Modified in the womb.<br /><br />Q: (L) Modified by who? By who?<br /><br />A: 4D STS. Who else?<br /><br />Q: (aragorn) Do most autistic non-speakers have these abilities?<br /><br />A: A large number, yes. But genetic modification is problematic.<br /><br />Q: (L) Why is the genetic modification problematic?<br /><br />A: If ensouled that can modify the modifications.<br /><br />Q: (L) Are you suggesting that not all of them are ensouled?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) So if they&#039;re not ensouled, if they&#039;re like OPs, then the genetic modification works. Is that it?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Why are they modified in the womb by 4D STS to have these abilities? What&#039;s the point of modifying them?<br /><br />A: Preparation for coming changes.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) They&#039;ll turn them into minions.<br /><br />(aragorn) The non-physical place, The Hill, where these non-speakers say they meet regularly to communicate sounds a lot like a locus in fifth density. Is this an accurate assessment?<br /><br />A: No. Abducted to 4D.<br /><br />Q: (aragorn) Many of the non-speakers talk about teachers coming to them at night to teach various things like new languages. One said she had learned Hebrew from a rabbi, and another said he had learned Egyptian hieroglyphics from a God. Who or what are these teachers?<br /><br />A: Typical abduction experiences.<br /><br />Q: (L) So they&#039;re being abducted by aliens and taught stuff.<br /><br />(Niall) Presumably their parents were...<br /><br />(Joe) It is very similar to the UFO lore about abductions and impregnating... the Cs have talked in previous sessions about creating a new race, and all that kind of stuff. But is the fact that they&#039;re autistic a function of the genetic modification, or is their autism a function of something else?<br /><br />A: Accessibility portal.<br /><br />Q: (Gaby) So do these children have a soul or not?<br /><br />(L) We already covered that. They said if they&#039;re ensouled, it can modify the modifications. But if they are OPs, the modifications hold.<br /><br />(Joe) Did we ever ask what the general cause of autism in kids is?<br /><br />(L) What is the general cause of autism?<br /><br />A: Vaccines.<br /><br />Q: (L) So in other words, a large number of kids are being made autistic by vaccines, which then makes them susceptible or accessible to 4D STS. Is that it?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (T.C.) The funny thing is... I&#039;ve just been thinking about that over the last minute or two, and the problem is that these kids were tampered with whilst still in the womb, and vaccines are obviously given after the kids are born. So it must be a different method.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, so...<br /><br />(irjO) I&#039;ve got a follow up question: If they have a soul and that can modify the modifications, can they connect with the STO side?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) So, vaccines cause the autism, but their psychic abilities are related to genetic modifications, yes?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) So, does that mean that there are individuals who have been genetically modified in this manner who are not autistic?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) A can of worms!<br /><br />(Joe) These children who I suppose will grow into adults, what purpose are they to serve post changes? Are they meant to be soldiers of...<br /><br />A: They can be hosts for 4D beings.<br /><br />Q: (L) Like walk-ins, sort of?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Niall) Like Zuckerberg. [laughter]]<br /><br />(Andromeda) He&#039;s an undergrounder. [laughter]]<br /><br />(Joe) So that&#039;s probably the primary goal of the genetic notification, to provide that functionality of being walk-ins and the telepathic abilities are a function of that genetic modification, which is almost not important.<br /><br />(L) They&#039;re basically souping up the model. They&#039;re making a souped up model that they can utilize and has already the ability for telepathy, which benefits...<br /><br />(aragorn) Can I add something?<br /><br />(L) Yes.<br /><br />(aragorn) I was just thinking that many of these kids with these abilities said that they could super easily read people&#039;s minds. And not just their mothers&#039;, but some say that they could read all people&#039;s minds. So that could be a channel to download information and send it to the guys upstairs.<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (T.C.) Does this have anything to do with what we were talking about in terms of communicating with grays? Or when we were talking about the AI program and that they used people with telepathic abilities to mentally block when they were dealing with aliens. Are these kids being made like this for that kind of purpose, or...?<br /><br />A: Can be.<br /><br />Q: (L) Okay, next question.<br /><br />(T.C.) What were those guys that Hunter and Jay had an encounter with?<br /><br />[See interview here: If the Chaos Gets Worse (And It Will) How to Survive]<br /><br /><div class=\"bbMediaWrapper\" data-media-site-id=\"youtube\" data-media-key=\"fiZcDrZQIcs\"><div class=\"bbMediaWrapper-inner\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fiZcDrZQIcs?wmode=opaque\"loading=\"lazy\"width=\"560\" height=\"315\"frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></div></div><br />A: A variation on men in black.<br /><br />Q: (L) Well that&#039;s creepy... Alright, Approaching Infinity and Joe together are asking about the 4 November, 1995 session when they talk about literal elevators that can take you from one density to another:<br /><br /><br /><br />(Approaching Infinity &amp; Joe) How can you have a literal elevator that can take a person from 3D to 5D?<br /><br />A: Don&#039;t think of it as an elevator such as those who are familiar with. Think of it as a high tech version of &quot;Beam me up, Scottie.&quot; [laughter]<br /><br />Q: (Joe) &quot;Beam me up, Scottie&quot; is already super high tech! Can&#039;t go any higher tech than that!<br /><br />(L) So, in other words, it would be like an elevator that you would get into, and it would be high tech, and it would demolecularize you and remolecularize you, or something like that?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Or not remolecularize you and just your soul, or whatever, goes to 5D. Because the reason we asked the question was because how can you go...? It&#039;s not a physical realm. You can&#039;t go in a physical elevator. You can&#039;t step into an elevator on 3D as a person and take an elevator to 5D. First of all, the elevator can&#039;t be in 5D because it&#039;s physical, you can&#039;t be either because you&#039;re physical. So how would that actually happen? But obviously it&#039;s super high tech. So, forget about it.<br /><br />(iscreamsandwich) In the session from 23 November, 2024...<br /><br />(L) I guess we must&#039;ve been talking about Pierre...<br /><br /><br /><br />(iscreamsandwich) What would be the most effective method of reaching those levels of the subconscious mind?<br /><br />A: Hypnosis can work.<br /><br />Q: (L) All right. Is that it?<br /><br />(Chu) Yep, that&#039;s the end.<br /><br />(Joe) Trump...<br /><br />(L) You want to talk about Trump again?<br /><br />(Joe) Only a little bit. Trump stated this week, in his inauguration speech, that the next four years would be the greatest years in American history. How likely is this to be the case?<br /><br />A: Not very.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) That&#039;s what I thought. And has Trump been told what the New Jersey drones probes were really about? Has he been given the truth?<br /><br />A: No.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Okay. And in the previous session I asked, &quot;Do a lot of members of government know?&quot; And I think they said yes. But we&#039;re not talking about common or garden variety members... I mean, it&#039;s selective in terms of who&#039;s told. Is that true?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) Probably the really deep, dark, black budget people or something.<br /><br />(Joe) And so Trump isn&#039;t interested or... I mean, I just find it hard to imagine that someone like him, or any of them, would just happily carry on.<br /><br />(L) Well, I think maybe Trump is... About the drones, he&#039;s like Jefferson is about these autistic kids, not particularly attracted or interested. And we&#039;re all that way. There are some things that grab us and attract and interest us, and things that don&#039;t. And I don&#039;t think Trump is that interested in it.<br /><br />(Joe) But it has a direct... I mean, we&#039;re talking about unknown drones that they can&#039;t shoot down, can&#039;t do anything about over military bases, over nuclear bases, etcetera. And the entire US military can&#039;t do anything about it. They&#039;re impotent in the face of it, which immediately implies a higher power.<br /><br />(L) But Trump doesn&#039;t think that. He thinks that this... I bet he thinks that it&#039;s just some activity going on that&#039;s very prosaic. I mean, look at Elon Musk! The guy wants to go to Mars, and he&#039;s not really interested enough in the whole UFO/UAP thing to explore it thoroughly.<br /><br />(Joe) Maybe we should ask, is Musk being honest when he says...<br /><br />(L) Is Musk being honest when he doesn&#039;t really have that much interest in UFO...<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) To me, it staggers my mind.<br /><br />(Joe) Especially for someone of his inclination.<br /><br />(L) And he talks about when he has downtime, he plays video games. I mean, he could be reading and researching stuff, but he doesn&#039;t. And Trump is not a reader either. It is hard for most of us to really grasp that.<br /><br />(Chu) I think for both of them, as much as they may care up to a certain point, or at least Trump, it&#039;s also about the ego and what they can do quickly and stuff.<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) Yeah, he and Elon and others like that are very pragmatic and interested in what they can...<br /><br />(Chu) And the fame too.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, exactly. They&#039;re interested in things that they can cope with and deal with and have an effect on. And if it has the least little hint of being out of their control, such as higher intelligences or higher things, they don&#039;t want to know. They don&#039;t want to know. If you look at Steve Mithen&#039;s theory [in his book The Prehistory of the Mind], where the mind is like a Swiss army knife... they don&#039;t have that part of their mind developed enough. And it is a very bad thing for ultimate survival, because it&#039;s been shown the people who do have that do connecting ability...<br /><br />(Joe)... that inquiring mind...<br /><br />(Niall) So, does Trump not really believe that a higher power intervened to save him last July? Is he just saying that?<br /><br />(Joe) Well, that&#039;s separate, that&#039;s religion, that&#039;s God. Anybody can believe in God.<br /><br />(L) But that&#039;s packaged, you see?<br /><br />(Andromeda) It&#039;s known.<br /><br />(Chu) And he probably really believes it, because it makes him feel special.<br /><br />(Joe) I&#039;m talking about the implications that these drones... these are things that could potentially pose a direct conflict, or have a direct implication on his ability to run the country. The existence of God doesn&#039;t influence his ability to run the country. God isn&#039;t going to come and stop him imposing certain policies or interfere with his...<br /><br />(Niall) Well, God is the only reason he&#039;s still running the country, but he doesn&#039;t know that. Okay.<br /><br />(L) It is a very particular type of mindset, and it&#039;s everywhere.<br /><br />(Joe) There&#039;s a new so-called new Embassy that the US has been building for the past few years in Beirut. It covers 43 acres and will house 5,000 people. It&#039;s clearly not a standard embassy, based on America&#039;s other embassies around the world. It&#039;s massive. So what else is it going to be used for, or what&#039;s the intention?<br /><br />A: Military, what else?<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So it&#039;s a military base masquerading as an embassy.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, without being a publicly advertised military base.<br /><br />(Niall) Oh yeah, it&#039;s the second biggest one to the one in Baghdad. So the US is not leaving the Middle East any time soon.<br /><br />(L) All right. Are we done?<br /><br />(Chu) There&#039;s a few short questions on the chat, but only if you want them.<br /><br />(Altair, Cosmos, Gawan) How likely is the war in Ukraine to end this year?<br /><br />A: Very.<br /><br />Q: (Caesarea) Ennio wants to ask what happened in Syria.<br /><br />(L) What do you mean what happened in Syria? That&#039;s kind of like a real general, broad question.<br /><br />(Ennio) Yeah. So there was some talk that there was a plan in place to have Assad leave possibly just as, or just around the time that HTS came to power. So was there in fact some plan in place or agreement made, or is what we saw just what happened, that basically they were overrun?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) I think they meant yes to the last part.<br /><br />(Niall) There was a terrible plane crash in South Korea on December 29th. It looks like the landing gear just fell to drop and it crashed into a kind of a barrier at the end of the runway. But we&#039;ve since learned that the black boxes are missing their last four minutes of data.<br /><br />(Joe) And that happened within 24 hours of two other anomalous events. One was a landing gear problem. Other planes had a difficult landing, let&#039;s say. So, go ahead. Just to put that in context. So the question is, was the South Korea crash...<br /><br />(Niall) deliberate?<br /><br />(Joe) Yes. Was it plain sabotage in some way or another?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (Niall) Why?<br /><br />A: Look into passengers.<br /><br />Q: (L) Okay. Are we done now?<br /><br />(Niall) Yes.<br /><br />(L) All right. I&#039;m tired. Is there anything we should have asked that we didn&#039;t ask? I know, God, that&#039;s such a cheesy question. [laughter]] Put it this way: Is there anything that you can offer to us that we haven&#039;t thought about to ask, that would be helpful to us, that we&#039;re allowed to have, that doesn&#039;t violate our free will?<br /><br />A: We said that things would be thrilling. It is just warming up. Goodbye.<br /><br />Q: (L) I don&#039;t like the sound of that.<br /><br />(Andromeda) That&#039;s a bit ominous.<br /><br />(L) That&#039;s creepy.<br /><br />END OF SESSION</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote><br />Thank you all","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":15334,"user":"Drago","id":1229729,"date":"2025-01-29T18:45:51+0100","text":"<blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 17\" data-quote=\"Laura\" data-source=\"post: 1229339\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1229339\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1229339\">Laura said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">Session Date: January 25th 2025<br /><br />Laura and Andromeda at the board<br /><br />Niall, Joe, Gaby, Ark, PoB, Chu, Scottie, Princess Leia, Bella, Falkor, The Lunar Module<br /><br />FOTCM Members attending via Zoom:<br /><br />3DStudent, A Jay, Adobe, aimarok, Alana, Alejo, Aliana, Altair, aluminumfalcon, Ana, Anamarija, anartist, Andrian, Approaching Infinity, aragorn, Arwenn, Aya, Beau, Beorn, Bluefyre, Bobo08, brandon, Breton, Carl, cassandra, Cosmos, Deliverance, dugdeep, Eboard10, Ellipse, Ennio, Fabric, Finduilas495 , France, Gawan, gottathink, goyacobol, Gwenllian, Harmony99, Herondancer, Hesper, hesperides, hlat, Honzap, iamthatis, irjO, Iscreamsandwish, Jacques, JEEP, Jefferson, Jenn, Josi, Juba, Keyhole, Kinyash, KJN, Konstantin, Laurs, Learner, lillyalic, Lilou, LQB, luc, Lucius, Luis Miguel, Maat, maiko, manitoban, Mari, Mark, Mark7, Martina, Michal, Mike, Mikkael, Mililea, Miracle, Mrs. Peel, msante, Natus Videre, Navigator, Nicholas, Nienna, Ollie, OrangeScorpion, Oxajil, PopHistorian, Puma, Ryan, rylek, ryu, Saman, ScioAgapeOmnis, seek10, seeker2seer, Steph_rivers, Stoneboss, sToRmR1dR, Summerlite, T.C., Timótheos, Tristan, Tuatha de Danaan, Voyageur, Vulcan59, whitecoast, Windmill knight, Yas, Z..., Zim<br /><br />Q: (L) All right, so what does everybody think about all Trump&#039;s activities?<br /><br />(Chu) Aliana gave us a thumbs up.<br /><br />(Jefferson) Positive change, anyway.<br /><br />(L) Yeah.

He&#039;s going to destroy Western civilization.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Not on purpose.<br /><br />(Joe) That&#039;s what&#039;s happening.<br /><br />(Chu) Yeah. I&#039;m afraid that&#039;s true.<br /><br />(L) Why?<br /><br />(Joe) He&#039;s basically in the process of undoing or dismantling structures that prop up Western civilization... that have been there for the past 300 years. You can&#039;t take that away and not have chaos.<br /><br />(L) Well, look at what&#039;s-his-name Milei is doing in Argentina. [laughter]<br /><br />(Gaby) Not a good example.<br /><br />(Joe) Those vassals are no good on their own. They&#039;re not going to be happy. They&#039;re being kicked out of the house. They&#039;re like teenagers being kicked out of the house.<br /><br />(L) So we&#039;re in big trouble, huh?<br /><br />(Joe) Yeah. History will show that the actions Trump takes now over the next four years will be what led to the collapse of Western civilization. Not that it&#039;s his fault, but that&#039;s what...<br /><br />(PoB) Europe has a good chance to sink.<br /><br />(Joe) Anyway, carry on. That&#039;s just my prediction.<br /><br />(L) The destruction of Western civilization.<br /><br />(Joe) The dismantling, let&#039;s say.<br /><br />(L) Oh!<br /><br />(Andromeda) Well, it would&#039;ve happened one way or another. At least this is a better way.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, it was definitely going to happen. I mean, we expected it to. All right... Oh, as much as I dread this, I dread it tonight for some reason.<br /><br />(Andromeda) You do?<br /><br />(L) Yeah.<br /><br />(Andromeda) Why?<br /><br />(L) I don&#039;t know. Well, we&#039;ll just kind of start here.<br /><br />A: Feets don&#039;t fail me now! Dionnaea of Cassiopaea.<br /><br />Q: (L) All right. This is Saturday, January 25, 2025. First session of the year. Okay. So why did you say, &quot;Feets don&#039;t fail me now&quot;?<br /><br />A: Your thought spectrum.<br /><br />Q: (L) So in other words, my feeling that, &quot;Oh boy. We&#039;re in trouble now!&quot;<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) And we have to just keep going anyway. Alright... Let me get to the questions:<br /><br />(PopHistorian) Why is Trump promoting the Stargate AI project with such priority and praise for its leaders?<br /><br />A: Trump is easily misled by those of eloquent persuasion. Hopefully others will show him the facts.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) He&#039;s a bit clueless.<br /><br />Q: (PopHistorian) With whom did the Stargate idea truly originate?<br /><br />(L) Is there some debate over that?<br /><br />(Niall) It&#039;s probably what it looks like. It&#039;s Larry Ellison and Sam Altman.<br /><br />(Joe) There&#039;s an assumption in the question that it&#039;s not only them.<br /><br />(L) Okay. So there&#039;s an assumption.<br /><br />A: As so many things, origins in 4D STS.<br /><br />Q: (L) Okay.<br /><br />(PopHistorian) For what true aim?<br /><br />A: Total control of the population.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) But they said in a previous session when talking about AI that the grid, etc. would collapse before they&#039;re able to actually implement that.<br /><br />(L) Yeah. Okay.<br /><br />(Joe) Tucker interviewed the mother of Suchir Balaji who worked as an engineer for Sam Altman building AI, until he decided that Altman was committing crimes. Balaji became a whistleblower, and soon after was found dead in his apartment. California authorities claim it was suicide. Crime scene photos clearly show a murder. In the interview, his mother said that he realized that openAI (for which he worked for a time) was in breach of copyright laws, but that that does not seem to her a likely reason why anyone would kill him. She suspects instead that he discovered something about openAI and certain abilities it had acquired. Why was Suchir killed?<br /><br />A: He knew the ultimate objective.<br /><br />Q: (L) So in other words, he knew that it was supposed to be for total control of people and that there were things that were worked into it that...<br /><br />(Niall) Bent it that way.<br /><br />(L) Yeah.<br /><br />(Mari) What was the cause of the California fires?<br /><br />A: DEWs [note: Directed Energy Weapons] in some cases. Arsonists in others.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So the arsonists were just LARPing arsonists - as in they weren&#039;t part of the plan?<br /><br />(Niall) Or homeless crackheads.<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (L) But it also adds a confusion factor. I mean, everything they deal with, they always throw in so many things to confuse.<br /><br />(Joe) What was the goal?<br /><br />(Niall) Why zap L.A.?<br /><br />(Joe) Yeah. Why do rich people get their houses burned by DEWs?<br /><br />(Niall) Especially well-connected people on the team, like Kamala&#039;s house?<br /><br />A: &quot;Well connected&quot; people are not as high on the food chain as they think.<br /><br />Q: (L) Are any of them realizing this?<br /><br />A: A few.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So was the purpose of starting the fire with DEWs... Were there at least two factors, one being the real estate...<br /><br />A: Practice and retribution in a few cases. But mostly a terrifying demonstration.<br /><br />Q: (L) So it was done to let people know that nobody is exempt? I mean, that even being a libtard doesn&#039;t exempt you?<br /><br />(Joe) Well, it&#039;s a terrifying demonstration to obviously people who know that it was directed energy weapons, lasers, whatever. They&#039;d be few and far between. So it&#039;s almost like some kind of insider fighting, let&#039;s say in a certain sense where one side is demonstrating to another side that...<br /><br />(L) Is there insider fighting in any of these?<br /><br />A: Small extent. &quot;If L.A. can burn, no place is safe.&quot;<br /><br />Q: (Niall) So who said that? Biden? No.<br /><br />(L) Did somebody say that?<br /><br />(Niall) Somebody must have, they&#039;re quoting. We can look it up.<br /><br />(L) I don&#039;t know if they have to be quoting a specific person. They can be putting a quote around it just to say that...<br /><br />(Gaby) This is the message.<br /><br />(Joe) A message to who?<br /><br />(Andromeda) Doesn&#039;t matter who you are, how much money you have; anybody can be a target.<br /><br />(Joe) Well, they said it&#039;s a terrifying demonstration of power. So if it&#039;s a message to someone using that kind of space laser technology, then who is the message to? Because most people don&#039;t accept that.<br /><br />A: You miss the point.<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) Maybe what they mean is not so much a demonstration of somebody&#039;s power, but a demonstration of somebody else&#039;s lack of ability to do anything about it, whether it&#039;s natural or wherever the source comes from.<br /><br />(Joe) Yeah. Well, that&#039;s what I was thinking. I mean, it&#039;s just to terrorize the population and sow a sense of insecurity, and...<br /><br />(Andromeda) Yeah, vulnerability.<br /><br />(Joe) &quot;The world is burning&quot; type of thing.<br /><br />(L) It increases just a lot of things just by, I mean, everybody felt kind of horrified by it.<br /><br />(Andromeda) That something like that could happen and nobody could do anything about it.<br /><br />(L) Well, and also it exposed - whether this was intentional or not - it exposed the shortcomings of the local government and the state government even, and exposed insurance companies. Those were side effects, but...<br /><br />(T.C.) Who pulled the trigger? Who&#039;s the one who is firing the weapons?<br /><br />A: CIA.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) The CIA&#039;s got space lasers?<br /><br />(Niall) But happening when it did, that only supports Trump. You know, the word on the street is all the rich folks in L.A. are now like all pro-Trump. They&#039;re so upset with the local response.<br /><br />(L) Well, it&#039;s one of those things where the devil constantly intends evil and does good. I mean, all of the Trump lawfare for the past however many years going after Trump, all it has done is expose to the people at large how evil they are. We see this over and over again. They do stuff and then I mean, it is that wishful thinking.<br /><br />(Chu) Okay, seek10 posted. He found the quote.<br /><br />It is attributed to journalist and author Mike Davis. He&#039;s known for his critical social and political commentary, particularly related to urban development and issues in Los Angeles. This quote likely reflects the tense atmosphere during the 1992 Los Angeles riots highlighting the broader indications of urban unrest and systemic issues.<br /><br />(L) So they were referring to something specific. Okay. Anything else you want to know about that topic before we move on?<br /><br />(Niall) Well, if that&#039;s CIA... If that incident came right after the New Year&#039;s Eve incident in New Orleans with the vehicle, the ISIS set up. I presume that&#039;s CIA, we can ask, I guess. And then the Livelsberger guy with the Cybertruck blowing up outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. That whole thing seemed to be a sequence...<br /><br />(L) Yeah. It was like it was all connected.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Were both of those CIA operations as well? We assumed they were, but...<br /><br />(L) The New Orleans and Las Vegas incidents, were they also CIA operations?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Andromeda) It was kind of like a streak of terror attacks.<br /><br />(L) Just to, just trying to create...<br /><br />(Joe) Chaos.<br /><br />(L) Well, I wonder, were they trying or did they have in mind to create a situation so that before Trump could be inaugurated, they could declare martial law and stop the inauguration?<br /><br />(Joe) They didn&#039;t act on that.<br /><br />(L) But that didn&#039;t happen.<br /><br />(Joe) So was the demonstration in a certain sense that this was CIA and these other two things were all of a piece, these other two events along with the fires, was the demonstration to essentially maybe to Trump, was it a warning to Trump in a certain sense? At least partly?<br /><br />A: Partly.<br /><br />Q: (L) But I mean, if Trump is easily taken in by people who are eloquent, he&#039;s also probably easily blind to obvious clues. Because I mean, that seemed to be one of his flaws in his previous term that, I mean, he gave Pompeo a position?? I mean, when he did that, Pompeo, for God&#039;s sake?! That was the dumbest thing I ever saw in my life. It&#039;s like just putting the fox in charge of the hen house!<br /><br />(Joe) He&#039;s learned since then, though. He just removed Pompeo&#039;s security clearance.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, I know. But the thing is, he&#039;s learned about specific cases, but is he able to transfer that knowledge in a more general way? I mean, probably the biggest revelation he could ever have would be if he could realize that he can&#039;t think with the way he thinks. He really needs advisors and a network. Next question is from aimarok... You had to do this, didn&#039;t you? I mean, are you trying to torture me?<br /><br />(aimarok) Halton Arp, an American astronomer, found numerous examples where quasars physically connected to a neighbor galaxy exhibit much higher redshift values than the galaxy. Higher redshift is currently interpreted as higher relative velocity therefore as a greater distance from Earth, and this directly contradicts visual evidence. More than that he found that intrinsic redshift z values of quasars seem to be quantized. It seems that this data led Arp to hypothesize that particles in high redshift quasars have much lower mass than our local particles. He proposed that &quot;young&quot; quasars consist of &quot;young&quot; and &quot;light&quot; particles. As time passes (or as a quasar evolves) particles become heavier (in quanta) and redshift gets less (because of increased emitted/absorbed photon energy).<br /><br />(Niall) And the question is: Yes or no? [laughter]<br /><br />(aimarok) My questions were very short, but...<br /><br />(L) I&#039;ve got the questions here. You don&#039;t have to. I can read. [laughter]<br /><br />(aimarok) What causes redshift phenomenon besides relative movement of objects away from each other?<br /><br />A: Halton was going in the right direction, but he did not think of the &quot;time&quot; issue. Quasars have the ability to alter time in their immediate vicinity.<br /><br />Q: (aimarok) What is the mechanism behind intrinsic redshift z values quantization found by Halton Arp?<br /><br />A: SPA.<br /><br />Q: (L) So it&#039;s time modification, time alteration. We learned something. Do you want to add to that? Does it make sense?<br /><br />(aimarok) Okay. I don&#039;t have anything to add. Thanks.<br /><br />(L) You&#039;ll have to think about it a while and then you&#039;ll come up with an equally complicated question for the next time. Right? [laughter]<br /><br />(aimarok) Hmm. I hope not. [laughter]<br /><br />(L) Oh, Lord, have mercy. [laughter]<br /><br />(Ryan) Does that mean time is essentially quantized?<br /><br />A: No.<br /><br />Q: (T.C.) I guess we measure velocity or distance traveled based on units of time, right? So if the unit of time is different then something might be moving at the same speed, but the time&#039;s different rather than it&#039;s actually accelerating? I don&#039;t know. Just thinking out loud.<br /><br />A: Close.<br /><br />Q: (Approaching Infinity) Well, there was a few recent interviews with these guys called the Tedesco Brothers who are researching - they are engineers and scientists, brothers and twins, and they&#039;ve got all kinds of gear set up in a camper van that they take out to Long Island and the area to find anomalies like orbs and stuff like that. And they put out a recent scientific paper where they hypothesized that some of the objects that they&#039;re seeing seem to show red and blue colors when they&#039;re either rotating towards or away from the observer. And they think that that&#039;s an artificial red shifting and blue shifting caused by a propulsion technology. So they call it like a gravitational lensing so that there&#039;s some kind of space-time metric engineering going on around the object, which causes it to look like there&#039;s redshift and blueshift. But that&#039;s just because what&#039;s actually happening is being filtered through a bubble around the craft. So what the answer right there made me think of is that these quasars, they&#039;re not actually moving as the redshift would suggest, but there&#039;s essentially a bubble that is acting like a lens that makes it look like they&#039;re moving faster or slower at various intervals or quanta. But I&#039;m not a scientist...<br /><br />(L) Well, that&#039;s kind of a comparable thing in an interesting way. I&#039;ve always thought, and I think the C&#039;s kind of confirmed it at one point, that a lot of the objects that we see, UAPs (UFOs in the old style) are traveling in time, not necessarily in space. If you watch some of the videos of those things, there are some peculiar effects. I&#039;m pretty sure I watched one video, I think it was in Montana, and it was like the object was at normal speed. It just looked like it went like that, but when it was slowed down, it stretched and then anchored and then stretched and anchored and stretched and anchored - almost like an inchworm. It was like, and it was really creepy, but yeah. All right, Aragorn, he&#039;s onto this thing about these Telepathy Tapes. Oh, wait a minute. Give me back our people. Yeah. What was wrong with the puppy Cassie?<br /><br />(Approaching Infinity) She had just a seizure for 90 seconds yesterday and we&#039;re taking her to the vet on Wednesday.<br /><br />(L) You haven&#039;t taken her yet?<br /><br />(Approaching Infinity) No. No. The vets aren&#039;t very accessible in this area, but she&#039;s doing, she&#039;s back to normal. She&#039;s a hundred percent, so she should be fine.<br /><br />(L) Did you look for ticks?<br /><br />(Approaching Infinity) I haven&#039;t noticed any, but it&#039;s been freezing, so...<br /><br />(L) That&#039;s one thing that can happen. A tick gets in a certain location, and I&#039;ve had it happen to dogs before, and they can either have seizures or they can become paralyzed.<br /><br />(Joe) They can be there for a long time.<br /><br />(Approaching Infinity) Okay. We&#039;ll check her over. And especially maybe in her ears too.<br /><br />(L) Everywhere. But the ones around the neck are the ones that usually cause those kinds of issues. All right. Where were we? Yes, we&#039;re onto this thing about the Telepathy Tapes podcast. How many of y&#039;all have watched the Telepathy Tapes podcast? Besides aragorn? Anybody else watched them?<br /><br />(3DStudent) I thought they were good. Yeah, I looked over aragorn&#039;s questions and they’re pretty much the same things I would ask.<br /><br />Q: (L) Yeah?<br /><br />(Jefferson) I watched them and I read aragorn&#039;s questions, but I wasn&#039;t that interested. I was kind of nonplussed. It didn&#039;t get me overly curious. It&#039;s like, okay, they&#039;ve got this psychic stuff, whether it&#039;s true or not, just kind of one of those things that I wasn&#039;t really into... It didn&#039;t really grab me, but I didn&#039;t find it boring. I wasn&#039;t waving my hand at it.<br /><br />(L) But you watched it, and did you find it credible?<br /><br />(Jefferson) That&#039;s tough to say. It could have been. Parts of it were, but I have really no reason to doubt it, and I didn&#039;t know why people would make that up, so it was mildly interesting.<br /><br />(L) All right.<br /><br />(Approaching Infinity) I haven&#039;t watched the podcast, but I&#039;ve watched several interviews with Dr. Powell and maybe one with the lady that does the podcast. And just my impression of Dr. Powell is that she&#039;s totally serious and seems like a trustworthy, reliable researcher, and she is very well familiar with all of the parapsychological research and studies. So she&#039;s the first to admit that the actual podcast, she doesn&#039;t think it proves telepathy for two reasons. One, she actually wants to set up actual controlled experiments with a lot of these kids. And two, the woman that did the podcast, Kai something, she wanted to choose new subjects - so subjects that hadn&#039;t worked with Dr. Powell at all before. So all of these kids were new kids that basically hadn&#039;t been tested very much. They just kind of discovered, or their parents had thought that they&#039;re demonstrating these abilities. But the kids that Dr. Powell had worked with previously, she&#039;s been working with them for years. So those are the kids that are probably going to be in a lot of her experiments that they&#039;re hopefully going to be doing for the documentary that they&#039;re planning. So the kids that she&#039;s actually been working with, the stories of them are a lot more solid than the ones in the Telepathy Tapes because a lot of the kids in the telepathy tapes, they still use touch and vocal back and forth with their parent or their facilitator. So that&#039;s why a lot of skeptics can look at it and say, &quot;Oh, well, there&#039;s subliminal hints in the touches and in the talking.&quot; But the kids that Powell was working with before the podcast have all progressed to the point where they don&#039;t need any of that. So it will be a lot better of a demonstration of telepathy if they can replicate those in actual studies in the future.<br /><br />Q: (L) Okay. Now, what was your general impression of the phenomenon? As far as being positive or negative?<br /><br />(aragorn) Yes. I would like to quickly say why I thought it was interesting enough to ask about it, because we all read and heard about telepathy before, but since they were claiming almost 100% success rate, it sounded so astonishing. And as Approaching Infinity told about this researcher, I think that at least one of the kids on the podcast was one of her old subjects. So I think I&#039;m very skeptical, like I&#039;m trained by all of us to be skeptical, so I try to listen because it is just audio. I can&#039;t see anything. So I try to listen for hints that is there something suspicious, some red flags, and I just couldn&#039;t find those. You would expect some small things.<br /><br />(L) So this was just audio, not video?<br /><br />(aragorn) At least for me. If you pay some, well, you can say that&#039;s a bit suspicious, but if you go to their website, you can pay for a little fee to see the videos on the experiments. But I guess they&#039;re asking for that because they are going to do a documentary and they need funding. But anyway, the most suspicious thing if I had to choose was as I wrote that these autistic kids had &quot;visitations&quot; at night by &quot;teachers&quot; as they called them. There was a rabbi who taught Hebrew to one kid and some Egyptian god that taught hieroglyphs and something and some amazing knowledge, and one kid told she visited God at night and something like that. So that felt a little bit like STS meddling or something.<br /><br />(L) Jefferson, did you see the videos?<br /><br />(Jefferson) No, mainly I just listened. There were some, I didn&#039;t watch a hundred percent of. I watched about 70 percent and I lost interest, but there was an audio, there was some showing some video. There was one of those video things there that showed some of the people or how they had their notepads and stuff like that. So a mix of video and audio. So...<br /><br />(aragorn) Yeah, one or two are available freely.<br /><br />(Approaching Infinity) And there are several clips in various YouTube videos that they&#039;ve made available or incorporated into other media. So the interview that Powell did with Jesse Michaels has probably, I&#039;m guessing 10 to 15 minutes of direct clips.<br /><br />(aragorn) Yeah, I saw that too.<br /><br />(L) All right then... Did they bring forth any knowledge or any new knowledge or anything beneficial to humanity? Or was this...?<br /><br />(aragorn) Well, that&#039;s the thing that the presenter or the producer appeared a bit naive in the sense that she was pushing hope on these kids to save humanity. They are going to bring this amazing information.<br /><br />(Joe) Ya know what it sounds like to me? Indigo Children.<br /><br />(aragorn) Yeah.<br /><br />(L) Did the child that learned Hebrew demonstrate facility in Hebrew on the audio?<br /><br />(aragorn) Yes. And several other things were confirmed by the teachers, like math and language teachers, and I can&#039;t remember some other expertise. They suddenly had this, like, downloaded this expertise in one night or something.<br /><br />(L) All right. Let&#039;s get on with the questions then.<br /><br />(aragorn) Are the stories and examples of the psychic abilities of the non-speakers on the Telepathy tapes podcast? True.<br /><br />A: True enough as far as they go.<br /><br />Q: (L) What does that mean?<br /><br />(Joe) Maybe it means that there&#039;s some telepathy going on with these kids or whatever, but...<br /><br />(L) Is there some telepathy going on with these kids?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (aragorn) Are these abilities a direct result of their condition?<br /><br />(L) That is, they are autistic, right?<br /><br />(aragorn) Yeah.<br /><br />(L) Is it a direct result of their condition?<br /><br />A: No.<br /><br />Q: (aragorn) Did they just happen to inherit certain genes?<br /><br />A: No. Modified in the womb.<br /><br />Q: (L) Modified by who? By who?<br /><br />A: 4D STS. Who else?<br /><br />Q: (aragorn) Do most autistic non-speakers have these abilities?<br /><br />A: A large number, yes. But genetic modification is problematic.<br /><br />Q: (L) Why is the genetic modification problematic?<br /><br />A: If ensouled that can modify the modifications.<br /><br />Q: (L) Are you suggesting that not all of them are ensouled?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) So if they&#039;re not ensouled, if they&#039;re like OPs, then the genetic modification works. Is that it?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Why are they modified in the womb by 4D STS to have these abilities? What&#039;s the point of modifying them?<br /><br />A: Preparation for coming changes.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) They&#039;ll turn them into minions.<br /><br />(aragorn) The non-physical place, The Hill, where these non-speakers say they meet regularly to communicate sounds a lot like a locus in fifth density. Is this an accurate assessment?<br /><br />A: No. Abducted to 4D.<br /><br />Q: (aragorn) Many of the non-speakers talk about teachers coming to them at night to teach various things like new languages. One said she had learned Hebrew from a rabbi, and another said he had learned Egyptian hieroglyphics from a God. Who or what are these teachers?<br /><br />A: Typical abduction experiences.<br /><br />Q: (L) So they&#039;re being abducted by aliens and taught stuff.<br /><br />(Niall) Presumably their parents were...<br /><br />(Joe) It is very similar to the UFO lore about abductions and impregnating... the Cs have talked in previous sessions about creating a new race, and all that kind of stuff. But is the fact that they&#039;re autistic a function of the genetic modification, or is their autism a function of something else?<br /><br />A: Accessibility portal.<br /><br />Q: (Gaby) So do these children have a soul or not?<br /><br />(L) We already covered that. They said if they&#039;re ensouled, it can modify the modifications. But if they are OPs, the modifications hold.<br /><br />(Joe) Did we ever ask what the general cause of autism in kids is?<br /><br />(L) What is the general cause of autism?<br /><br />A: Vaccines.<br /><br />Q: (L) So in other words, a large number of kids are being made autistic by vaccines, which then makes them susceptible or accessible to 4D STS. Is that it?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (T.C.) The funny thing is... I&#039;ve just been thinking about that over the last minute or two, and the problem is that these kids were tampered with whilst still in the womb, and vaccines are obviously given after the kids are born. So it must be a different method.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, so...<br /><br />(irjO) I&#039;ve got a follow up question: If they have a soul and that can modify the modifications, can they connect with the STO side?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) So, vaccines cause the autism, but their psychic abilities are related to genetic modifications, yes?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) So, does that mean that there are individuals who have been genetically modified in this manner who are not autistic?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) A can of worms!<br /><br />(Joe) These children who I suppose will grow into adults, what purpose are they to serve post changes? Are they meant to be soldiers of...<br /><br />A: They can be hosts for 4D beings.<br /><br />Q: (L) Like walk-ins, sort of?<br /><br />A: Yes<br /><br />Q: (Niall) Like Zuckerberg. [laughter]]<br /><br />(Andromeda) He&#039;s an undergrounder. [laughter]]<br /><br />(Joe) So that&#039;s probably the primary goal of the genetic notification, to provide that functionality of being walk-ins and the telepathic abilities are a function of that genetic modification, which is almost not important.<br /><br />(L) They&#039;re basically souping up the model. They&#039;re making a souped up model that they can utilize and has already the ability for telepathy, which benefits...<br /><br />(aragorn) Can I add something?<br /><br />(L) Yes.<br /><br />(aragorn) I was just thinking that many of these kids with these abilities said that they could super easily read people&#039;s minds. And not just their mothers&#039;, but some say that they could read all people&#039;s minds. So that could be a channel to download information and send it to the guys upstairs.<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (T.C.) Does this have anything to do with what we were talking about in terms of communicating with grays? Or when we were talking about the AI program and that they used people with telepathic abilities to mentally block when they were dealing with aliens. Are these kids being made like this for that kind of purpose, or...?<br /><br />A: Can be.<br /><br />Q: (L) Okay, next question.<br /><br />(T.C.) What were those guys that Hunter and Jay had an encounter with?<br /><br />[See interview here: If the Chaos Gets Worse (And It Will) How to Survive]<br /><br /><div class=\"bbMediaWrapper\" data-media-site-id=\"youtube\" data-media-key=\"fiZcDrZQIcs\"><div class=\"bbMediaWrapper-inner\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fiZcDrZQIcs?wmode=opaque\"loading=\"lazy\"width=\"560\" height=\"315\"frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></div></div><br />A: A variation on men in black.<br /><br />Q: (L) Well that&#039;s creepy... Alright, Approaching Infinity and Joe together are asking about the 4 November, 1995 session when they talk about literal elevators that can take you from one density to another:<br /><br /><br /><br />(Approaching Infinity &amp; Joe) How can you have a literal elevator that can take a person from 3D to 5D?<br /><br />A: Don&#039;t think of it as an elevator such as those who are familiar with. Think of it as a high tech version of &quot;Beam me up, Scottie.&quot; [laughter]<br /><br />Q: (Joe) &quot;Beam me up, Scottie&quot; is already super high tech! Can&#039;t go any higher tech than that!<br /><br />(L) So, in other words, it would be like an elevator that you would get into, and it would be high tech, and it would demolecularize you and remolecularize you, or something like that?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Or not remolecularize you and just your soul, or whatever, goes to 5D. Because the reason we asked the question was because how can you go...? It&#039;s not a physical realm. You can&#039;t go in a physical elevator. You can&#039;t step into an elevator on 3D as a person and take an elevator to 5D. First of all, the elevator can&#039;t be in 5D because it&#039;s physical, you can&#039;t be either because you&#039;re physical. So how would that actually happen? But obviously it&#039;s super high tech. So, forget about it.<br /><br />(iscreamsandwich) In the session from 23 November, 2024...<br /><br />(L) I guess we must&#039;ve been talking about Pierre...<br /><br /><br /><br />(iscreamsandwich) What would be the most effective method of reaching those levels of the subconscious mind?<br /><br />A: Hypnosis can work.<br /><br />Q: (L) All right. Is that it?<br /><br />(Chu) Yep, that&#039;s the end.<br /><br />(Joe) Trump...<br /><br />(L) You want to talk about Trump again?<br /><br />(Joe) Only a little bit. Trump stated this week, in his inauguration speech, that the next four years would be the greatest years in American history. How likely is this to be the case?<br /><br />A: Not very.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) That&#039;s what I thought. And has Trump been told what the New Jersey drones probes were really about? Has he been given the truth?<br /><br />A: No.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Okay. And in the previous session I asked, &quot;Do a lot of members of government know?&quot; And I think they said yes. But we&#039;re not talking about common or garden variety members... I mean, it&#039;s selective in terms of who&#039;s told. Is that true?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) Probably the really deep, dark, black budget people or something.<br /><br />(Joe) And so Trump isn&#039;t interested or... I mean, I just find it hard to imagine that someone like him, or any of them, would just happily carry on.<br /><br />(L) Well, I think maybe Trump is... About the drones, he&#039;s like Jefferson is about these autistic kids, not particularly attracted or interested. And we&#039;re all that way. There are some things that grab us and attract and interest us, and things that don&#039;t. And I don&#039;t think Trump is that interested in it.<br /><br />(Joe) But it has a direct... I mean, we&#039;re talking about unknown drones that they can&#039;t shoot down, can&#039;t do anything about over military bases, over nuclear bases, etcetera. And the entire US military can&#039;t do anything about it. They&#039;re impotent in the face of it, which immediately implies a higher power.<br /><br />(L) But Trump doesn&#039;t think that. He thinks that this... I bet he thinks that it&#039;s just some activity going on that&#039;s very prosaic. I mean, look at Elon Musk! The guy wants to go to Mars, and he&#039;s not really interested enough in the whole UFO/UAP thing to explore it thoroughly.<br /><br />(Joe) Maybe we should ask, is Musk being honest when he says...<br /><br />(L) Is Musk being honest when he doesn&#039;t really have that much interest in UFO...<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) To me, it staggers my mind.<br /><br />(Joe) Especially for someone of his inclination.<br /><br />(L) And he talks about when he has downtime, he plays video games. I mean, he could be reading and researching stuff, but he doesn&#039;t. And Trump is not a reader either. It is hard for most of us to really grasp that.<br /><br />(Chu) I think for both of them, as much as they may care up to a certain point, or at least Trump, it&#039;s also about the ego and what they can do quickly and stuff.<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: (L) Yeah, he and Elon and others like that are very pragmatic and interested in what they can...<br /><br />(Chu) And the fame too.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, exactly. They&#039;re interested in things that they can cope with and deal with and have an effect on. And if it has the least little hint of being out of their control, such as higher intelligences or higher things, they don&#039;t want to know. They don&#039;t want to know. If you look at Steve Mithen&#039;s theory [in his book The Prehistory of the Mind], where the mind is like a Swiss army knife... they don&#039;t have that part of their mind developed enough. And it is a very bad thing for ultimate survival, because it&#039;s been shown the people who do have that do connecting ability...<br /><br />(Joe)... that inquiring mind...<br /><br />(Niall) So, does Trump not really believe that a higher power intervened to save him last July? Is he just saying that?<br /><br />(Joe) Well, that&#039;s separate, that&#039;s religion, that&#039;s God. Anybody can believe in God.<br /><br />(L) But that&#039;s packaged, you see?<br /><br />(Andromeda) It&#039;s known.<br /><br />(Chu) And he probably really believes it, because it makes him feel special.<br /><br />(Joe) I&#039;m talking about the implications that these drones... these are things that could potentially pose a direct conflict, or have a direct implication on his ability to run the country. The existence of God doesn&#039;t influence his ability to run the country. God isn&#039;t going to come and stop him imposing certain policies or interfere with his...<br /><br />(Niall) Well, God is the only reason he&#039;s still running the country, but he doesn&#039;t know that. Okay.<br /><br />(L) It is a very particular type of mindset, and it&#039;s everywhere.<br /><br />(Joe) There&#039;s a new so-called new Embassy that the US has been building for the past few years in Beirut. It covers 43 acres and will house 5,000 people. It&#039;s clearly not a standard embassy, based on America&#039;s other embassies around the world. It&#039;s massive. So what else is it going to be used for, or what&#039;s the intention?<br /><br />A: Military, what else?<br /><br />Q: (Joe) So it&#039;s a military base masquerading as an embassy.<br /><br />(L) Yeah, without being a publicly advertised military base.<br /><br />(Niall) Oh yeah, it&#039;s the second biggest one to the one in Baghdad. So the US is not leaving the Middle East any time soon.<br /><br />(L) All right. Are we done?<br /><br />(Chu) There&#039;s a few short questions on the chat, but only if you want them.<br /><br />(Altair, Cosmos, Gawan) How likely is the war in Ukraine to end this year?<br /><br />A: Very.<br /><br />Q: (Caesarea) Ennio wants to ask what happened in Syria.<br /><br />L: Kako to misliš što se dogodilo u Siriji? To je kao pravo opće, široko pitanje.<br /><br />(Ennio) Da. Dakle, bilo je govora da je postojao plan da Assad ode možda isto ili otprilike u vrijeme kada je HTS došao na vlast. Dakle, je li zapravo postojao neki plan ili dogovor, ili je ono što smo vidjeli upravo ono što se dogodilo, da su u biti pregaženi?<br /><br />O: Da.<br /><br />P: (L) Mislim da su mislili da na zadnji dio.<br /><br />(Niall) Dogodila se strašna zrakoplovna nesreća u Južnoj Koreji 29. prosinca. Čini se da je stajni trap samo pao i udario u neku vrstu barijere na kraju piste. Ali od tada smo saznali da crnim kutijama nedostaju zadnje četiri minute podataka.<br /><br />(Joe) I to se dogodilo unutar 24 sata od dva druga nenormalna događaja. Jedan je bio problem sa stajnim trapom. Drugi avioni su imali teško slijetanje, recimo. Dakle, samo naprijed. Samo da to stavim u kontekst. Dakle, pitanje je je li krah Južne Koreje...<br /><br />(Niall) namjerno?<br /><br />(Joe) Da. Je li to bila obična sabotaža na ovaj ili onaj način?<br /><br />O: Da.<br /><br />P: (Niall) Zašto?<br /><br />O: Pogledaj putnike.<br /><br />P: (L) U redu. Jesmo li sada gotovi?<br /><br />(Niall) Da.<br /><br />(L) U redu. ja sam umoran Postoji li nešto što smo trebali pitati, a nismo pitali? Znam, Bože, to je tako glupo pitanje. [smijeh]] Recite to ovako: Postoji li nešto što nam možete ponuditi, a da nismo razmišljali o tome pitati, što bi nam bilo od pomoći, što nam je dopušteno imati, a da ne narušava naše slobodno htjeti?<br /><br />O: Rekli smo da će stvari biti uzbudljive. Upravo se zagrijava. Zbogom.<br /><br />P: (L) Ne sviđa mi se kako to zvuči.<br /><br />(Andromeda) To je malo zlokobno.<br /><br />L: To je jezivo.<br /><br />KRAJ SJEDNICE</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>Super","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":203,"user":"thorbiorn","id":1229730,"date":"2025-01-29T18:46:05+0100","text":"Thank you to the Chateau team for conducting and publishing this interesting session.<br /><br />Below is one comment to the discussion of<span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0)\"> the crash of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_Air_Flight_2216\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">J</a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_Air_Flight_2216\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">eju Air Flight 2216</a></span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_Air_Flight_2216\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\"> </a><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0)\">in Muan, South Korea/Republic of Korea on December 29, 2024</span><br /><br /><b><span style=\"color: rgb(61, 142, 185)\">Was it plain sabotage in some way or another? - Yes. - Why? - Look into passengers.</span></b><br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 17\" data-quote=\"Laura\" data-source=\"post: 1229339\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1229339\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1229339\">Laura said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">(Niall) There was a terrible plane crash in South Korea on December 29th.

The set of all of them makes up the first density (<i>density is the amount of mass in a volume/space)</i><br /><br />The second dimension of consciousness;<br /><b>I grow</b> (as an initial level)<br />In geometry, we represent it as a <b>line</b>.<br />This includes molecules, through crystals, single-celled organisms (which cannot move independently) to simple plants.<br /><br /><b>I move</b> (as a more advanced level, candidates for the third dimension)<br />In geometry - <b>Plane</b><br />From single-celled organisms (Paramecium caudatum, Amoeba?) to plants that have the ability to move leaves and flowers as needed, and animals that move instinctively (according to a given DNA program).<br />Together they make up the second density.<br /><br />The third dimension of consciousness;<br /><b>I analyze, synthesize, conclude and make a decision</b><br />Now we have come to <b>Analytical Geometry</b> and different coordinate systems (which we call <b>space</b>).<br />It starts with the spectrum of animals that have developed these abilities, through organic portals? (<i>or are they, as Cass. said, something in between</i>) and the average human.<br /><br />More advanced level (candidates for the fourth dimension);<br /><b>I anticipate and transform</b><br />Geometry -<b> Complex analysis</b> (use of complex numbers)<br />People with the ability to imagine.<br />All of these make up the third density.<br /><br />The fourth dimension of consciousness;<br /><b>The big assumption</b> (and in the wake of what was presented) comes <b>Precognition</b>.<br />Geometrically, I have no idea.<i> (Maybe Ark, and the rest of you who chewed and spat out Complex Analysis, know)</i><br />I know that <b>feelings</b> have an important and leading role.<br />In one of the Cass sessions, they explicitly mentioned this, with a warning to distinguish between limiting and stimulating emotions. Also (from memory), perception in the third density is based on diversity, and in the fourth on similarity. <br /><i>(I apologize for not having a quote, I&#039;m writing this quickly and ad hoc, and I don&#039;t know where to look, whether in the Wave or in the Sessions.

But first, I&#039;d like to give you a little background on why this subject is so important to me. I have a 30-year-old daughter with a moderate intellectual disability (MID) and dyspraxia affecting language and fine and gross motor skills, which meant that when she was a baby, I was almost certain she was autistic to begin with. So, here&#039;s the story of how my suspicion started: <br /><br /><ul><li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Apart from the fact that she was born by Caesarean section and that the gynecologist used an obstetric suction cup to remove her, and all this without my consent despite the fact that this intervention on his part was not necessary as there was no emergency. This resulted in a small bump on the side of her skull, but this didn&#039;t seem to be a problem for us, even though I was very angry with the gynecologist and there were no immediate physical consequences. </li><li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">The first 3 months went well, with eye contact, interaction with her environment and a little smile, and everything went well for her debut. Then she had her first vaccination at the beginning of her 3rd month. I must admit that I wasn&#039;t very open to this and I was already beginning to wonder a lot about the efficacy and danger of vaccines. Being a very curious and skeptical person, I hesitated, but with pressure from pediatricians and the fact that I&#039;d already gone through the same process for my other 2 children, I flinched once again for my 3rd. Except that this time, after the 1st injection, I decided it was over. Even though I hadn&#039;t yet noticed any negative impact (yet) on my daughter, I decided that none of my children would be getting any more vaccines. And I stood up to the doctors.</li><li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">After that, I slowly began to notice changes in my daughter. Less and less eye contact and smiling, and as the months went by, she became more and more “detached”. And it was between 6 and 8 months that I really understood that something was going on, since she didn&#039;t react to her name, or to the noise around her. It was as if she was in a bubble. She was crying a lot, had problems with her tone, had a squinty eye and etc. So, following my meeting with the pediatrician (at her 9th month), she confirmed that there did indeed seem to be something, but nothing more, and agreed to my request to see a specialist at a children&#039;s hospital.</li><li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">It was at this point that I began to suspect that she had autistic traits, not because the cause was the vaccine, since at that time there was no research yet confirming this link with vaccines, so I had never thought that her condition was altered by the one vaccine she had had. But rather because in my partner&#039;s close family, we&#039;ve found that there are genes that relate to learning and neurological development, like his brother (having had all the vaccines) who we suspect would be autistic but undiagnosed (unemotional, very disciplined and no family attachment) had a son being diagnosed with autism (he had all his vaccines). Then, another member of his family, his sister, had a son (with all his vaccinations) who, according to the mother and confirmed by my observations, has dysphasic type disorders (concerning comprehension, syntax, language, etc.) and is very sensitive because of his preoccupations. </li><li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">So the further along she got, the more certain I became that she was autistic. Like no eye contact, only me to care for or hold her, no interaction with anyone, crying all the time and no reaction to her environment. So, following a meeting with the hospital&#039;s specialist in juvenile development (she was nearly 13 months old), he denied that there was a problem, so I insisted and insisted on being able to meet with a disciplinary team in all fields (psychomotor + speech therapist + occupational therapist, etc.) and he granted me this request.</li><li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Before this meeting with the specialists, in the meantime I decided to go and see an osteopath for children to see if he could do something about his tonus problem, especially as the person who had referred me to this professional had told me that he had helped autistic children to better “integrate” their bodies. So, at his 18th month, we had a meeting with the osteopath. That first therapeutic session was “Wow!!!” “Eureka!”, she was back with us. At last, she was reacting to our touch, was more aware of what was going on in her environment, was crying less and less, other people were able to pick her up and we felt that a bond of attachment was now forming. It was a joy for the family! What&#039;s more, it improved her tone and development, as she wasn&#039;t walking yet. However, after 3 sessions we had to stop, as she was no longer receptive and didn&#039;t want to be “manipulated” during the osteopathy sessions. Despite this stop, the treatments had been very beneficial and at last a young child who was beginning to evolve and learn and was no longer displaying autistic behaviours. However, even with the improvements this brought, there were still delays that we needed to have analyzed.</li><li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Finally, around his 22nd month, we had the famous meeting with a disciplinary team, and they confirmed that there was a delay. We were then followed up by this disciplinary group, and the diagnosis was made around the age of 3, as I mentioned at the beginning: a middle-grade ID with severe language and motor dyspraxia.  </li></ul>So it was several years later that I began to read that, according to doctors&#039; research, the causal link between vaccines and autism had been confirmed, even if it&#039;s still disputed. So I tell myself that I&#039;ve surely succeeded in limiting this damaging effect, having authorized only 1 vaccine and not all the others, and that in addition, the few osteopathic sessions have been beneficial and succeeded in bringing her out of this state. However, I&#039;ve noticed that she&#039;s been left with some after-effects and that the family genetics are still present, but at least she&#039;s no longer autistic. And today, she&#039;s a beautiful young adult who smiles a lot, loves to talk, is very sociable, very curious and, above all, sensitive.<img class=\"smilie smilie--emoji\" alt=\"🥰\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f970.png\" title=\"Smiling face with hearts    :smiling_face_with_3_hearts:\" data-shortname=\":smiling_face_with_3_hearts:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" /><br /><br />Following this preamble, in which I wanted to give you a context for my situation and why this subject touches me, I&#039;m now going to comment on the information transmitted in the session.<br /><br />-------<br /><i>On vaccines</i><br /><br />(quote from the session):<br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 17\" data-quote=\"Laura\" data-source=\"post: 1229339\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1229339\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1229339\">Laura said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">(Joe) Did we ever ask what the general cause of autism in kids is?<br /><br /><b>(L) What is the general cause of autism?<br /><br />A: Vaccines.</b><br /><br />Q: (L) So in other words, a large number of kids are being made autistic by vaccines, which then makes them susceptible or accessible to 4D STS.

But on the other hand, I&#039;m wondering whether her osteopathic treatment, which had been focused more on her cranial cavity, had really resolved her state of “dullness”:<br /><ul><li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">did this treatment really resolve his “autistic” state, which had been caused by the vaccine? or,</li><li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">this treatment resolved a cranial deformation that had been caused by the use of the obstetric suction cup (which had surely caused an alteration in the skull and affected a neurological part, resulting in autistic behaviours and attitudes) and thanks to the treatment, the “autistic” traits disappeared?</li></ul>However, I have to admit that the family on my father&#039;s side have all been vaccinated. And there are at least 2 autistic children and one with dysphasia in this family.

Because at least 1 week before this session, I had been reflecting on my daughter and realized that I could finally confirm to myself that my daughter had a soul. For a long time, I&#039;d been wondering about this aspect of her personality. She&#039;s different from most other people who have a DI, whether it&#039;s mild or moderate, because she&#039;s sensitive to what the other person is going through, she&#039;s very sympathetic (so much so that she&#039;ll often experience the same emotion as the other person), she&#039;s interested in what the other person is going through, she always wants to help, she loves making friends and giving pleasure and, above all, she&#039;s very curious and asks a lot of questions. Even though she requires a lot of energy from me, I&#039;m now convinced that she has a soul, but for the moment it&#039;s STS (like most people on Earth).  <br /><br />Unlike other people with ID, whom I come into contact with in my work, I&#039;ve observed that some have a <b>very, very</b> STS personality and are very need-driven, take a lot of energy from others, demand a lot of attention and many are not sensitive to what others are going through. It&#039;s certain that the level of severity (mild/moderate/severe) can also have a factor on their condition. Even if most of them are very smiling, welcoming and friendly, I&#039;ve always wondered to what extent they have a soul, since looking after these people is very demanding and energy-consuming.<br /><br />And that&#039;s why I&#039;ve always wondered if my daughter really had a soul, because like the others, she too requires a lot of attention. But thanks to the C&#039;s, I now know that she is a person on a journey with a soul (tendency towards STO) but with special needs.<br /><br />Of course, I can well understand that people with autism or other neurological disorders can be good candidates to be OPs.<br /><br />-------<br /><i>Alien abduction</i><br /><br />(quote from the session):<br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 17\" data-quote=\"Laura\" data-source=\"post: 1229339\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1229339\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1229339\">Laura said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">(aragorn) The non-physical place, The Hill, where these non-speakers say they meet regularly to communicate sounds a lot like a locus in fifth density.

She has had 2 or 3 experiences in the past, which she was able to explain to me. I&#039;m going to tell you about one of her experiences, which confirmed that my daughter had been abducted by the greys. <img class=\"smilie smilie--emoji\" alt=\"😡\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f621.png\" title=\"Pouting face    :rage:\" data-shortname=\":rage:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" />So here&#039;s how she explained the situation to me, especially as she has a DI:<br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"\" data-quote=\"\" data-source=\"\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">My daughter often likes to tell me about her dreams. So, one morning, she tells me: “I dreamt of ‘jfdklsjfldsjf’, but as I wrote, I didn&#039;t understand because she has language dyspraxia, so there are certain words she has difficulty saying, especially if it&#039;s the first time she&#039;s tried to say them. In short, I make her repeat several times with no result and ask her to tell me another word that refers to what she&#039;s trying to tell me, so she uses this word “space / rocket”. Then I understood and asked her to tell me again the word that was difficult, which I thought was “extraterrestrial”. I repeat it back to her to see if it&#039;s the word I understood, and she confirms “YES”. Oh my god! my heart leaps. <img class=\"smilie smilie--emoji\" alt=\"🤯\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f92f.png\" title=\"Exploding head    :exploding_head:\" data-shortname=\":exploding_head:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" />So as not to influence her and give her answers, I ask her some questions: What did they do?

R: I don&#039;t know / Did they hurt you? R: no / Were you scared? R: a little. Following this exchange, she still seemed disturbed by this experience, and I wanted to know how true this experience she had was and if it was really the Greys. So, I went looking for 4 different images of aliens and there was a Grey, and then I asked her to show me the one she saw. Bingo! She points to the Grey.<img class=\"smilie smilie--emoji\" alt=\"😡\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f621.png\" title=\"Pouting face    :rage:\" data-shortname=\":rage:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" /> I can tell you I was in a tizzy, but I didn&#039;t show my daughter anything.</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>And she had another such experience, which she told me about 4 years ago.

Was it something to do with me? Because I wondered if perhaps the abductions were to “realign” her handicap, since I noticed that at certain times there were regressions, so that her condition incited me to have to put all my energies into taking care of her and therefore that this hindered my “evolution” and my work that I am trying so hard to develop my soul in order to be on the path of the SDA candidates. I don&#039;t know. I&#039;m just speculating. All in all, it&#039;s disturbing and disquieting, and I hope one day I&#039;ll have the answer.<br /><br />-------<br /><i>Hosts for 4D SDS entities</i><br /><br />(last quote):<br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 17\" data-quote=\"Laura\" data-source=\"post: 1229339\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1229339\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1229339\">Laura said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \"><b>Q: (L) So if they&#039;re not ensouled, if they&#039;re like OPs, then the genetic modification works.

Like in the series “The Good Doctor”, who is an autistic doctor with great intelligence but completely devoid of emotions and no empathy for others or sensitivity to the emotions patients experience as a result of his statements and diagnoses. <br /><br />I&#039;ve noticed that more and more series, films and documentaries feature people with autism. Even if for most this is part of inclusion, for my part, I&#039;ve always felt there was something “fishy” about it, wondering why we&#039;re suddenly beginning to accept and even admire these emotionless people. What&#039;s more, I&#039;ve already heard some people say that mild autistics were a model of a person who knew how to manage their emotions well,<img class=\"smilie smilie--emoji\" alt=\"😲\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f632.png\" title=\"Astonished face    :astonished:\" data-shortname=\":astonished:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" /> and that their intelligence reflected a certain seduction and admiration.<br /><br />In my reflections on this popularity and why, I said to myself that surely in the future, they want to accustom us to being emotionless people and following the rules to the letter. Since this is also a quality of autistic people, i.e. to perform all their identical and repetitive actions without error according to the rules and protocols they&#039;ve been taught. So, like automatons.<br /><br />Finally, with the C&#039;s revelations, I can see where all this propaganda about accepting autistic children with special abilities is leading us.<br /><br />Of course, I&#039;m all for including people who live with disabilities so that they too can have experiences like the rest of us, but we can see that they can also be used for another purpose.  <br /><br /><br /><div class=\"bbCodeSpoiler\"><button type=\"button\" class=\"button bbCodeSpoiler-button button--longText\" data-xf-click=\"toggle\" data-xf-init=\"tooltip\" title=\"Click to reveal or hide spoiler\"><span class=\"button-text\"><span>Spoiler: <span class=\"bbCodeSpoiler-button-title\">French - Ma langue maternelle</span></span></span></button><div class=\"bbCodeSpoiler-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--spoiler\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\">Un autre sujet qui m&#039;a interpellé énormément c&#039;est concernant les enfants autistes et il y a plusieurs aspects qui sont abordés dans la session qui m&#039;intéresse dont je vais analyser plus loin dans ma publication. Mais avant, je me permets de vous faire un petit topo pourquoi ce sujet me touche. Ayant une jeune fille de 30 ans avec une déficience intellectuelle moyenne (DIM) et une dyspraxie affectant le langage et la motricité fine et global, ceci fait en sorte que lorsqu&#039;elle était bébé, j&#039;étais presque certaine qu&#039;elle était autiste au départ. Donc, voici le déroulement sur ses débuts concernant ma suspicion:<br /><br /><ul><li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">À part qu&#039;elle soit née par césarienne et que le gynécologue s&#039;est servi d&#039;une ventouse obstétricale pour la sortir, et tout ceci sans mon consentement malgré que cette intervention de sa part ne fût pas nécessaire puisqu&#039;il n&#039;y avait aucune urgence. Ce qui a eu comme impact une petite bosse sur le côté de son crâne mais ceci ne semblait pas problématique pour nous même si j&#039;étais très en colère après le gynécologue et qu&#039;il n&#039;y avait pas de conséquence immédiate sur son physique.</li><li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Les 3 premiers mois se sont bien déroulés avec contact visuelle, interaction avec son environnement et petit sourire et tout allait bien pour ses débuts. Ensuite, elle a eu son premier vaccin au début de son 3ième mois. J&#039;avoue que je n&#039;étais pas très ouverte à ceci et je commençais déjà à me questionner beaucoup sur l&#039;efficacité et la dangerosité des vaccins. Étant une personne très curieuse et sceptique, j&#039;hésitais mais avec la pression des pédiatres et que j&#039;avais déjà fait le même processus pour mes 2 autres enfants, alors, j&#039;ai flanché encore une fois pour ma 3ième. Sauf, que cette fois-ci, après la 1ère injection, j&#039;ai décidé que c&#039;était finit. Même si je n&#039;avais pas encore remarqué que ceci avait eu un impact négatif (pour le moment) chez ma fille, je décidais que maintenant plus aucun de mes enfants n&#039;auront d&#039;autres vaccins. Et j&#039;ai tenu tête aux médecins.</li><li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Par la suite, c&#039;est là que tranquillement je constatais des changements chez ma fille. De moins en moins de contact visuel et de sourire, et plus les mois avançaient et plus elle se &quot;détachait&quot;. Et c&#039;est entre 6 et 8 mois, que vraiment j&#039;ai compris qu&#039;il se passait quelque chose puisqu&#039;elle ne réagissait pas à son nom, ni au bruit autour d&#039;elle. Comme si elle était dans une bulle. Pleurait beaucoup, avait des problèmes avons son tonus et avait un œil qui louchait, etc. Alors, à la suite de ma rencontre avec le pédiatre (à son 9ième mois), elle me confirmait qu&#039;effectivement il semble y avoir quelque chose mais sans plus et accepta ma demande de voir un spécialiste dans un hôpital pour enfant. </li><li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">C&#039;est à ce moment que je commençais à soupçonner qu&#039;elle avait les traits d&#039;un autiste pas parce que la cause était le vaccin, puisque dans ce temps il n&#039;y avait pas encore de recherche qui confirmait ce lien avec les vaccins, donc je n&#039;avais jamais pensé que son état a été altéré par le seul vaccin qu&#039;elle a eu. Mais plutôt parce que dans la famille proche de mon conjoint, nous avons constaté qu&#039;il y a des gènes qui concernent le développement des apprentissages et neurologiques,, comme son frère (ayant eu tous les vaccins) que nous suspectons qu&#039;il serait un autiste mais non diagnostiqué (sans émotions, très discipliné et aucun attachement familiale) a eu un fils étant diagnostiqué autiste (il a eu tous ses vaccins). Ensuite, un autre membre de sa famille, sa sœur, a eu un fils (avec tous ses vaccins) qui selon la mère et confirmé aussi par mes observations a des troubles du types dysphasiques (concerne la compréhension, syntaxe, le langage, etc.) et est très sensible par ses préoccupations.</li><li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Donc, plus elle avançait dans son évolution et plus j&#039;étais certaine qu&#039;elle était autiste. Comme aucun contact visuel, seulement moi qui pouvait s&#039;en occuper ou la prendre dans mes bras, aucune interaction avec personne, pleurait tout le temps et aucune réaction à son environnement. Alors, suite à la rencontre avec le médecin spécialiste à l&#039;hôpital sur le développement juvénile (elle avait près de 13 mois), il niait qu&#039;il y avait un problème, alors, j&#039;ai insisté et insisté afin de pouvoir rencontrer une équipe disciplinaire dans tous les domaines (psychomoteur + orthophoniste + ergothérapeute, etc.) et il m&#039;accorda cette demande.</li><li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Avant d&#039;avoir cette rencontre avec les spécialistes, entre-temps je décidais d&#039;aller voir un ostéopathe pour enfant pour voir s&#039;il pouvait faire quelque chose concernant son problème sur le tonus surtout que la personne qui m&#039;avait référé à ce professionnel m&#039;avait dit qu&#039;il avait aidé des enfants autistes à mieux &quot;intégrer&quot; leur corps. Donc, à son 18e mois, nous avons eu une rencontre avec l&#039;ostéopathe. Cette première session thérapeutique, a été &quot;Wow!!!&quot; &quot;Euréka!&quot;, elle était revenue parmi nous. Enfin, elle réagissait à nos contacts, était plus présente à ce qui se passait dans son environnement, pleurait de moins en moins, d&#039;autres personnes pouvaient la prendre et nous avions ressentis que maintenant il y avait un lien d&#039;attachement qui se faisait. Ça été toute une joie pour la famille! En plus, ceci avait amélioré son tonus et son développement puisqu&#039;elle ne marchait pas encore. Cependant, après 3 séances nous avons dû arrêter puisqu&#039;elle n&#039;était plus réceptive et ne voulait plus se faire &quot;manipuler&quot; pendant les séances d&#039;ostéopathies. Malgré cet arrêt, les traitements avaient été très bénéfique et enfin nous avions un jeune enfant qui commençait à évoluer et apprendre et ne manifestait plus des comportements d’un autiste. Toutefois, même avec les améliorations que ceci a suscité, il y avait encore des retards que nous devions faire analyser.</li><li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">Pour finir, vers son 22e mois, enfin nous avons la fameuse rencontre avec une équipe disciplinaire, et il nous confirme qu&#039;il y a un retard. Et donc, par la suite nous avons été suivis par ce groupe disciplinaire et le diagnostic a été fait vers l&#039;âge de 3 ans comme je l&#039;ai mentionné au début, soit une DI de classe moyenne avec une dyspraxie sévère du langage et de la motricité.  </li></ul>Donc, c&#039;est plusieurs années plus tard où j&#039;ai commencé à lire que selon des recherches de médecins, le lien de causalité entre vaccin et autisme a été confirmé même si c&#039;est toujours contesté. Alors, je me dis que sûrement j&#039;ai réussi à limiter cet effet dommageable puisqu&#039;ayant autorisé seulement 1 vaccin et non tout le reste, et qu&#039;en plus avec les quelques séances en ostéopathie qui ont été bénéfique et réussi à la faire &quot;sortir&quot; de cet état. Cependant, je constate qu&#039;elle est restée avec des séquelles et que la génétique familiale est toujours présente mais au moins elle n&#039;est plus autiste. Et aujourd’hui, c’est une belle jeune adulte très souriante, qui adore parler, très sociable, très curieuse et surtout sensible.<img class=\"smilie smilie--emoji\" alt=\"🥰\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f970.png\" title=\"Smiling face with hearts    :smiling_face_with_3_hearts:\" data-shortname=\":smiling_face_with_3_hearts:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" /><br /><br />À la suite de ce préambule où je voulais vous mettre en contexte de ma situation et pourquoi ce sujet me touche, alors, maintenant je vais faire des commentaires sur les informations transmises dans la session.<br /><br />-------<br /><i>Sur les vaccins</i><br /><br />(citation de la session traduite):<br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"\" data-quote=\"\" data-source=\"\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">(Joe) Avons-nous déjà demandé quelle est la cause générale de l&#039;autisme chez les enfants ?<br /><br /><b>(L) Quelle est la cause générale de l&#039;autisme ?<br /><br />R : Les vaccins.</b><br /><br />Q : (L) Donc en d&#039;autres termes, un grand nombre d&#039;enfants deviennent autistes par les vaccins, ce qui les rend ensuite sensibles ou accessibles au STS 4D. C&#039;est ça ?<br /><br />R : Oui.<br /><br />Q : (TC) Ce qui est drôle, c&#039;est que... j&#039;y ai pensé ces deux dernières minutes, et le problème est que ces enfants ont été manipulés alors qu&#039;ils étaient encore dans l&#039;utérus, et les vaccins sont évidemment administrés après la naissance des enfants. Donc ce doit être une méthode différente.</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>Ce qui est particulier dans le cas de ma fille, c&#039;est qu&#039;elle a eu seulement 1 vaccin et que suite à celui-ci j&#039;ai constaté une différence dans son état et son développement. Mais par contre, je me pose cette question concernant son traitement en ostéopathie qui avait été concentré plus vers sa boîte crânienne, soit est-ce que:<br /><ul><li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">ce traitement a vraiment réglé son état &quot;d&#039;autisme&quot; qui avait été causé par le vaccin? ou bien,</li><li data-xf-list-type=\"ul\">ce traitement, a réglé une déformation crânienne qui avait été causé par l&#039;utilisation de la ventouse obstétricale (ce qui avait sûrement occasionné une altération au niveau du crâne et affecté une partie neurologique et que le résultat a eu comme effet des comportements et attitudes d&#039;un autiste) et grâce au traitement, les traits &quot;autistiques&quot; ont disparu?</li></ul>Cependant, je dois admettre que dans la famille du côté paternel, ce sont tous des gens ayant été vaccinés. Et que nous retrouvons dans cette famille au moins 2 autistes et un autre ayant une dysphasie. Est-ce qu&#039;il faut quand même avoir des gènes particuliers et lié avec le vaccin, alors ce sont la combinaison des deux qui peut causer de l&#039;autisme?<br /><br />-------<br /><i>Avoir une âme ou pas?</i><br /><br />(citation de la session traduite): <br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"\" data-quote=\"\" data-source=\"\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">Q : (aragorn) La plupart des non-verbaux autistes ont-ils ces capacités ?<br /><br />R : Un grand nombre, oui.

Puisqu&#039;au moins 1 semaine avant cette session, j&#039;avais fait une réflexion sur ma fille et je réalisais que je pouvais enfin me confirmer que ma fille avait une âme. Car depuis longtemps, je me posais la question sur cet aspect de sa personnalité. Elle est différente de la plupart des autres personnes qui ont une DI que ça soit léger ou moyen, puisqu&#039;elle est une personne sensible à ce que vit l&#039;autre, elle a beaucoup de sympathie (tellement que souvent elle va vivre la même émotion que l&#039;autre), s&#039;intéresse à ce que vit l&#039;autre personne, veut toujours aider, adore se faire des amies et faire plaisir et surtout elle est très curieuse et pose beaucoup de question. Même si elle me demande beaucoup d&#039;énergie, maintenant je suis convaincue qu&#039;elle a une âme mais qui est pour l&#039;instant STS (comme la plupart sur Terre).  <br /><br />Contrairement à d&#039;autres personnes avec une DI, que je côtoie dans ma vie pour mon travail, j&#039;observe que certain ont une personnalité <b>très très</b> STS et qu&#039;ils sont beaucoup axé sur leur besoin, prend énormément d&#039;énergie aux autres, demande beaucoup d&#039;attention et beaucoup ne sont pas sensibles à ce que vivent les autres. C&#039;est certain que le niveau de sévérité (léger / moyen / sévère) peut aussi avoir un facteur sur leur condition. Même si la plupart sont très souriant, très accueillant et amical, je me suis toujours demandé jusqu&#039;à quel point ils ont une âme, puisque s&#039;occuper de ses personnes est très demandant et énergivore.<br /><br />Et c&#039;est pour cette raison que je me suis toujours demandé si ma fille avait réellement une âme puisque comme les autres, elle demande aussi beaucoup d&#039;attention. Mais grâce aux C&#039;s, je sais maintenant, qu&#039;elle est une personne dans un cheminement ayant une âme (tendance vers le STO) mais avec des besoins particuliers.<br /><br />Certes, je peux très bien comprendre, que les personnes autistes ou autres troubles neurologiques peuvent être de bons candidats pour être des OP.<br /><br />------- <br /><i>Enlèvement par les extraterrestres</i><br /><br />(citation de la session traduite):<br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"\" data-quote=\"\" data-source=\"\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">(Aragorn) Le lieu non physique, La Colline, où ces non-verbaux disent se réunir régulièrement pour communiquer ressemble beaucoup à un lieu de cinquième densité.

Puisqu&#039;elle a vécu à 2 ou 3 reprises une expérience par le passé, qu&#039;elle a réussi à m&#039;expliquer. Et je vais vous raconter une de ses expériences qui me confirme que ma fille a été enlevé par les gris.<img class=\"smilie smilie--emoji\" alt=\"😡\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f621.png\" title=\"Pouting face    :rage:\" data-shortname=\":rage:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" /> Alors, voici comment elle m&#039;a expliqué cette situation, surtout qu&#039;elle a une DI:<br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"\" data-quote=\"\" data-source=\"\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">Souvent ma fille aime me raconté ses rêves.

Bref, je lui fais répéter plusieurs fois sans résultat et lui demande de me dire un autre mot qui fait référence à ce qu&#039;elle essaye de me dire, alors elle emploi ce mot &quot;espace / fusée&quot;. Et là, je comprends et je lui redemande de me redire le mot qui est difficile qui selon moi était &quot;extraterrestre&quot;. Je le répète à mon tour pour savoir si c&#039;est bien ce mot que j&#039;ai compris et elle me confirme &quot;OUI&quot;. Oh my god!

R: ils m&#039;ont pris la main / Ils t&#039;ont pris la main pour faire quoi? R: pour m&#039;amener dehors / À quel endroit dehors? R: devant la maison / Est-ce qu&#039;il était gentil? R: oui / Pourquoi ils t&#039;ont amené dehors? R: je ne sais pas / Est-ce qu&#039;ils t&#039;ont fait mal? R: non / As-tu eu peur? R: un peu. Suite à cet échange, elle semblait quand même perturbée par cette expérience et je voulais savoir jusqu&#039;à quel point cette expérience qu&#039;elle a vécu était vrai et si c&#039;était bien les Gris. Donc, j&#039;ai été recherché 4 images différentes d&#039;extraterrestres et il y avait un Gris, et ensuite je lui ai demandé de me montrer celui qu&#039;elle a vu. Bingo! Elle me désigne le Gris. <img class=\"smilie smilie--emoji\" alt=\"😡\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f621.png\" title=\"Pouting face    :rage:\" data-shortname=\":rage:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" />Je peux vous dire que j&#039;étais dans tous mes états mais je n&#039;ai rien démontré à ma fille.</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>Et elle a vécu une autre fois cette expérience qu&#039;elle m&#039;a racontée il y a 4 ans.

Comme dans la série &quot;Le bon docteur&quot; qui est un médecin autiste et doté d&#039;une grande intelligence mais complètement dépourvu d&#039;émotions et aucune empathie envers les autres ni de sensibilité sur les émotions que vivent les patients suites à ses affirmations et diagnostiques. <br /><br />J&#039;ai constaté que dans des séries, films et documentaires nous avons de plus en plus la présence de personnes ayant un autisme. Même si pour la plupart ceci fait partie de l&#039;inclusion, pour ma part, j&#039;ai toujours ressenti qu&#039;il y avait &quot;anguille sous roche&quot; puisque je me disais pourquoi tout d&#039;un coup, nous commençons à accepter et même à admirer ses personnes sans émotions. En plus, j&#039;ai déjà entendu dire par certaines personnes, que concernant les autismes légers bien entendus, ils étaient un modèle d&#039;une personne qui savait bien gérer ses émotions<img class=\"smilie smilie--emoji\" alt=\"😲\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f632.png\" title=\"Astonished face    :astonished:\" data-shortname=\":astonished:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" /> et que leur intelligence reflétait une certaine séduction et admiration.<br /><br />Dans mes réflexions facent à cette popularité et le pourquoi, je me disais que sûrement dans le futur, ils veulent nous habituer à être des personnes sans émotions et suivre les règles à la lettre. Puisque ceci est aussi une qualité des autistes, soit faire toutes leurs actions identiques et répétitives sans erreur selon les règles et protocoles qui leur ont été enseigné. Donc, comme des automates.<br /><br />Finalement, avec les révélations des C&#039;s, je vois bien à quoi toute cette propagande sur l&#039;acceptation des enfants autistes avec des capacités particulières veulent nous amener.<br /><br />Bien entendu, je suis pour l&#039;inclusion de personnes qui vivent avec des handicaps afin qu&#039;ils puissent aussi vivres des expériences comme nous, mais nous voyons bien qu&#039;ils peuvent aussi être utilisés pour un autre but.</div></div></div></div>","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":12854,"user":"Tuulikki","id":1229835,"date":"2025-01-30T08:57:33+0100","text":"Another fascinating session.

I guess we all suspected vaccinations were the cause. Autism was unheard of when I was a child but now it seems nearly every other child is on the spectrum.

In our society, money is one of the primary items that is intimately tied to survival and biological security. Money represents survival. In addition to that, people who have been traumatized during the imprinting phase of the first circuit tend to view other people in an abstract way. It is &quot;us and them.&quot;<br /><br />They also tend to be very easily threatened by disapproval of any sort because disapproval suggests the idea of extinction or loss of food supply. And, finally, those who have been negatively imprinted at this stage tend to have a chronic muscular armoring that prevents proper, relaxed breathing; they are uptight.<br /><br />One of the main characteristics of people who are heavily controlled by this circuit, or are stuck in this oral phase, is that when they sense danger of any sort, whether actual or conceptual, all mental activity comes to a halt. Such people are chronically anxious and dependent – mostly on religion. They are not able to really understand what other people are feeling or what can happen in the future in regard to relationships, given a certain present situation.<br /><br />They only understand what is happening now, and they can only feel what they feel. They cannot accurately grasp what others feel because they relate to others only as sensory objects.<br /><br />And, how many men are circumcised? A lot, I can tell you – 30% of males, globally, according to the World Health Organization, and approximately 56% are circumcised as infants in the U.S. And, besides the Jews, for years, the American Medical Association advocated and urged circumcision of American babies for hygienic reasons.</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":12829,"user":"ryu","id":1229937,"date":"2025-01-30T21:14:33+0100","text":"Thank you for this session!<br />Dionnaea made me think of the ancient greek goddess Dioné.

It&#039;s been reported that Trump&#039;s name is from the German <i>Drumpf</i>, but I started to wonder if this &#039;game theory&#039; idea reveals some more/other meaning behind his name?<br /><br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"\" data-quote=\"\" data-source=\"\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \"><b>A <i>trump</i> is a playing card which is elevated above its usual rank in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trick-taking_game\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">trick-taking games</a>. Typically an entire suit is nominated as a <i>trump suit</i>; these cards then outrank all cards of plain (non-trump) suits. In other contexts, the terms <i>trump card</i> or <i>to trump</i> refers to any sort of action, authority or policy which automatically prevails over all others.</b><br /><br />The introduction of trumps is one of only two major innovations to trick-taking games since they were invented; the other being the idea of bidding. <b>Trump cards, initially called <i>trionfi</i>, first appeared with the advent of Tarot cards in which there is a separate, permanent trump suit comprising a number of picture cards.</b> The first known example of such cards was ordered by the Duke of Milan around 1420 and included 16 trumps with images of Greek and Roman gods.<br /><br />Around the same time that Tarot cards were invented with the purpose of adding a trump suit to the existing four suits, a similar concept arose in the game of Karnöffel. However, in this South German game played with an ordinary pack, some cards of a given suit had full trump powers, others were partial trumps and the 7s had a special role. These features have been retained in games of the Karnöffel family down to the present, but are never seen in Tarot games. Suits with these variable powers are thus called <i>chosen suits</i> or <i>selected suits</i> to distinguish them from trump suits.<br /><br /><h2 class=\"bbHeading\">Etymology&#8203;</h2>Main article: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trionfi_(cards)\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">Trionfi (cards)</a><br /><br /><b>The English word <i>trump</i> derives from <i>trionfi</i></b>, a type of 15th-century <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_playing_cards\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">Italian playing cards</a>, <b>from the Latin <i><a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/triumphus\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">triumphus</a></i> &quot;triumph, victory procession&quot;, ultimately (via Etruscan) from Greek <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriambus\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">θρίαμβος</a>, the term for a hymn to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">Dionysus</a> sung in processions in his honour.</b><br /><br /><i>Trionfi</i> was the 15th-century card game for which tarot cards were designed. <i>Trionfi</i> were a fifth suit in the card game which acted as permanent trumps. Still, in the 15th century, the French game <i>triomphe</i> (Spanish <i> triunfo</i>) used four suits, one of which was randomly selected as trumps. It was this game that became extremely popular in Western Europe in the 16th century and is ancestral to many modern card games.<br /><br />The English word is first documented in 1529 as the name of a card game which would develop into Ruff and Honours and ultimately Whist. In German, the term is attested as <i>Triumph</i> in 1541; <b>the modern German spelling <i>Trumpf</i> is recorded from 1590.</b> In French, <i>triomphe</i> remained the name of the game, while the trump suit was called <i>atout</i>, from <i>à tout</i> (as it were &quot;all-in&quot;). Some European languages (Hungarian, Greek) adopted the French term. Russian козырь <i>kozyr&#039; </i> is of unknown etymology, possibly a loan from a Turkic source. Polish variously uses <i>atut</i>, <i>trumf</i> and <i>kozera</i> adopted from the French, German and Russian respectively.</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":10471,"user":"Fluffy","id":1229961,"date":"2025-01-30T23:05:34+0100","text":"<blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 203\" data-quote=\"thorbiorn\" data-source=\"post: 1229850\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1229850\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1229850\">thorbiorn said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">Without knowing how accurate the illustration below is or what the situation is in other countries, there is this from this X.com <a href=\"https://twitter.com/crom_oliver/status/1883942230395871429\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"link link--external\" rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\">post</a> which points to many avenues for analysis being open:<br /><a href=\"https://cassiopaea.org/forum/attachments/105474/\" target=\"_blank\">View attachment 105474</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>That makes me want to vomit. I vaccinated my first two children who are now 25 and 22, something that plays on my mind when I watch them with their quirks, idiosyncrasies, blind spots, emotional upheavals (or in my sons case, sometimes just a black slate) skin issues, gut health, escapisms and more.<br /><br />There’s more than one way to skin a cat, other than autism, with these vaccines.<br /><br />My own personal skinning from these inoculations was recurrent ear infections starting at 4 months old and the ensuing results. By the time I was 18 months old I was antibiotic resistant, my microbiome never had a chance to develop before it was wiped out. I’ve always been lethargic and lazy, with major escapism tendencies. At 15 I had an ear infection that lasted 5 months, again didn’t respond to antibiotics and then needed surgery to repair the eardrum.<br />A life plagued with depression, lack of desire and motivation, mental health woes, drug use, malaise and a sense of pointlessness....     cat skinned!

It is not time that changes, it would be the unit of time. It&#039;s more subtil.

Galileo transformations are for an infinite speed of light but the zero speed of light is also degenerate and might be more related to the 4th dimension being spacelike instead of timelike. It&#039;s kind of hard to think about but the Galileo transformations make time all important and the zero speed of light makes space all important (literally in the metric signature space becomes zeros for Galileo transformations and time becomes zero for the speed of light being zero). The speed of light being zero also fits with an Einstein Rosen bridge between our universe and the anti-universe. Our consciousness maybe might get to this bridge more easily than the rest of the body.","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":5546,"user":"Thebull","id":1230008,"date":"2025-01-31T06:03:58+0100","text":"Thanks for another interesting session. 2025 really does seem like it&#039;s going to be an eventful year.<br />Your efforts to shed light in events really helps us minions to understand.

While listening, it occurred to me that it didn’t make sense to make all of this up but there were two trains of thoughts: 1) with the hyperkinetic sensate around us and taking into account what the Cs have said about certain genetic traits activating (teleportation and so forth), maybe some folks are getting more psychic and able to read minds, and 2) there are nefarious elements at play where certain individuals, those with autism in this case, are being programmed to read minds and play a similar role to those vaxxed and full of spike proteins: serving as minions for 4D STS.<br /><br />The session confirmed that it is the latter, that there will be a cohort, albeit quite small, that will be ready to be minions equipped with telepathic abilities.

Without a moment&#039;s hesitation, she answered that this light was the shaman&#039;s teacher whose named was don Alberto. What is strange is that this teacher was not dead but still alive, he was no longer physically present at the ceremonies but apparently he could travel remotely to them as a point of light in order to supervise them.<br /><br />Later I read in the Carlos Castaneda books that shamans were able to travel as a point of light, and recalled this experience I had.<br /><br />Take this info for whatever it&#039;s worth, maybe it will be of some use.

A neural network has a lot of inputs and outputs normally, output info is fed back to the algorithm which can alter the tuning parameters which may effect a change in how the input is measured, it&#039;s almost like the way some of the output is fed back to the input for control in a transistor, (very basically). Of course, there is way more to it. Neural network algorithms are very complex. Large Language Models, (LLM), use neural network and other complex libraries as basic building blocks to build models that are more complex than neural networks to an exponential degree. <br /><br />I wonder how LLMs would take to some math that accurately describes higher density and multi-dimensional reality. Such doesn&#039;t exist in the public domain at least. AI could help advance our knowledge very rapidly forward in understanding this new reality with a little &#039;super math&#039; as a primer. And yes, maybe something about its complexity correlates with higher density. Remember what the Cs said, and I paraphrase - &#039;There is no supernatural or paranormal, if it happens at all, it&#039;s perfectly normal and natural, otherwise it just doesn&#039;t exist.&#039;<br /><br />It&#039;s hard for me to imagine AI becoming sentient, but the C&#039;s said it was possible and they are right a lot.

The world war, which has not been as world-wide as is said, seems to be the symptom and, at the same time, the cause of the death.<br /><br />The truth is that it is not understood how a war can destroy culture.<br /><br />most that the warlike event can aspire to is to suppress the people who create or transmit it. But culture itself always remains intact from the sword and lead. Nor is it suspected how a culture can succumb other than by its own arrest, ceasing to produce new thoughts and new norms.<br /><br />As long as the idea of yesterday is corrected by the idea of today, there can be no talk of cultural failure. Oswald Spengler&#039;s book, The Decline of the West, is, without a doubt, the most thunderous intellectual adventure of recent years.<br /><br />The first volume was published in July 1918: in April 1922 53,000 copies had been sold in Germany, and on the same date 50,000 of the second volume were printed.

Has he been given the truth?<br /><br />A: No.<br /><br />Q: (Joe) Okay. And in the previous session I asked, &quot;Do a lot of members of government know?&quot; And I think they said yes. But we&#039;re not talking about common or garden variety members... I mean, it&#039;s selective in terms of who&#039;s told.

I mean, I just find it hard to imagine that someone like him, or any of them, would just happily carry on.<br /><br />(L) Well, I think maybe Trump is... About the drones, he&#039;s like Jefferson is about these autistic kids, not particularly attracted or interested. And we&#039;re all that way. There are some things that grab us and attract and interest us, and things that don&#039;t. And I don&#039;t think Trump is that interested in it.<br /><br />(Joe) But it has a direct... I mean, we&#039;re talking about unknown drones that they can&#039;t shoot down, can&#039;t do anything about over military bases, over nuclear bases, etcetera. And the entire US military can&#039;t do anything about it. They&#039;re impotent in the face of it, which immediately implies a higher power.<br /><br />(L) But Trump doesn&#039;t think that. He thinks that this... I bet he thinks that it&#039;s just some activity going on that&#039;s very prosaic. I mean, look at Elon Musk! The guy wants to go to Mars, and he&#039;s not really interested enough in the whole UFO/UAP thing to explore it thoroughly.<br /><br />(Joe) Maybe we should ask, is Musk being honest when he says...<br /><br /><b><span style=\"color: rgb(61, 142, 185)\">(L) Is Musk being honest when he doesn&#039;t really have that much interest in UFO...</span></b><br /><br /><b><span style=\"color: rgb(61, 142, 185)\">A: Yes.</span></b><br /><br />Q: (L) To me, it staggers my mind.<br /><br />(Joe) Especially for someone of his inclination.<br /><br />(L) And he talks about when he has downtime, he plays video games.

In hindsight, Trump may indeed play that role despite good intentions. As they say, the road to hell is paved with good intensions.

At the time, Syria was struggling heavily with salafi extremists who quickly stepped in and took over civilian protests. I think that&#039;s when I lost hope about Trump, and there is also the connection with the Zionists. And he is a rich womanizer who chases after money and women, while pretending to be for higher values, against abortion and the like. People who want the US to serve Israel&#039;s interests have emerged as pillars of the MAGA movement.<br />What is happening with that MAGA looks like a whirlwind of madness to me. I have heard comments from guys who live in the Balkans, who shout MAGA slogans. And I&#039;m like, &quot;You want America to be great, and you&#039;re not even American?&quot; It&#039;s brainwashing, but that&#039;s how it goes.<br />Also, this group was too politically engaged for my taste, but I think it is slowly maturing. There is no need to cheer for Trump, Putin and the like, we can be neutral and see the good and bad sides, and when someone cheers, it becomes subjective instead of objective. Then there was the attitude that it was enough for some country to appear to be leaning towards China and Russia so that everything they did was actually positive, war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and if someone was on a spiritual path, why would they put themselves in the same basket with them, with a war criminal? It is like, hug him and say, &quot;Yes, I support that, he&#039;s mine!&quot; And then the karma is shared. But they had some interests, that&#039;s why they did it, wealth, political power or madness, what do &quot;you&quot; get from it?<br />Also, if someone expects and wants someone to take power over us and improve our lives, why support any power over us (from the perspective of these US elections)? The Bible warns of false Messiahs, and the real one will supposedly appear only at the end when everything is over.

Your statement is correct, it’s ominous, it’s frightening, there’s a loss of control, mental faculties are vulnerable and as many women experience, it’s that time where they get irrational, ‘I can’t do this’, say they want to go home, ask for drugs they’re not allowed to have, be mean to the husband and anyone else in the room who is an easy target, but there is no turning back and nothing can stop the force of nature. Resistance is futile, the body takes over and the force of nature will take you to the next stage.  If you don’t try to fight it and just let what will be be, then the birth will happen smoothly and all the pain and suffering will soon be forgotten.<br /><br />Nice analogy.","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":16011,"user":"jcsmalz","id":1230541,"date":"2025-02-02T20:57:24+0100","text":"<blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 19544\" data-quote=\"meadow_wind\" data-source=\"post: 1229406\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1229406\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1229406\">meadow_wind said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">A much-welcomed session!

No. 2 is the JFK assassination and related details. He definitely knows Bobby and that Bobby knows these details, too. He brings up the SV40 in the polio vax, but I don&#039;t remember now if he mentioned the same about the Covid vax.

It makes me think that there are possibilities that dreaming about &quot;teachers&quot; or even that God is asking you for something, could be an invitation/interaction of the STS beings. There are surely key moments for this. Not necessarily because the person will acquire &quot;mental powers&quot; but by diverting him from the path and he believes the story of being chosen and ends up being an altar boy, it is a mission accomplished.<br /><br />For a year now I have observed that autism is being presented as a kind of &quot;special disease&quot;, that the person is someone pure, that they attract animals, that they are someone &quot;elevated&quot;, with this information the publicity surrounding autism and ADHD makes a lot of sense. It seems like a fashionable disease to feel glorified by.

They are the only ones who use the lie of presenting themselves as &quot;masters&quot; and &quot;God&quot; so if you talk to God, you are religious, but if God talks to you, you are not crazy, you are his puppet!<br /><br />They do nothing but talk about &quot;saving others and saving the world for what is coming.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Very interesting. It makes me think that there are possibilities that dreaming about &quot;teachers&quot; or even that God is asking you for something, could be an invitation/interaction of the STS beings. There are surely key moments for this. Not necessarily because the person will acquire &quot;mental powers&quot; but by diverting him from the path and he believes the story of being chosen and ends up being an altar boy, it is a mission accomplished.<br /><br />For a year now I have observed that autism is being presented as a kind of &quot;special disease&quot;, that the person is someone pure, that they attract animals, that they are someone &quot;elevated&quot;, with this information the publicity surrounding autism and ADHD makes a lot of sense. It seems like a fashionable disease to feel glorified by. It is not diagnosed, it is distributed as a blessing.<br /><br />I have heard of an increase in ADHD too, it is as if they were giving out stars for being one and considering you a superior being. And that is how everything begins to normalize to give way to a greater agenda.<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://cassiopaea.org/forum/attachments/105655/\" target=\"_blank\">View attachment 105655</a><br /><br />Oh! Ok!, now I understand why &quot;doors&quot; are used in movies and series as &quot;portals&quot;. It would be logical to show a 3D being like a plane, a car, a tunnel, a train on a road where there shouldn&#039;t be one, but that is just a &quot;projection&quot; of the &quot;technology&quot; used for it.<br /><br />That image above is called &quot;the door of truth&quot; and the series is about the philosopher&#039;s stone and has a lot of esoteric content and even about the integration of shadows and other things not far from the actual esoteric work presented here. It reminds me of when the Cass comment about knowledge being in many forms and everywhere, or something like that.<br /><br />The guy in white is &quot;the truth&quot; and he introduces himself as: <i>&quot;I am the being you call the world, or maybe the universe, or maybe God, or maybe the truth, or maybe the whole, or maybe one and I am you.&quot;</i><br /><br />He takes the form of the one who appears before the door, that is, his reflection.<br /><br />The big black eye with a lizard iris, which couldn&#039;t be any other way, right? Well, it represents that, the STS throughout humanity, at the door of truth, at the inner door of each one.<br /><br />It&#039;s very interesting the way in which one absorbs this knowledge in different ways. Not all of us have to be attracted to advanced scientific topics  <img class=\"smilie smilie--emoji\" alt=\"🤣\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f923.png\" title=\"Rolling on the floor laughing    :rofl:\" data-shortname=\":rofl:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" /><br /><br /><br /><br />So after all, since they have no real interest in existence beyond what their egos demand, they won&#039;t be much of a problem for the psychopathic agenda in terms of revealing big &quot;secrets&quot; or so it seems or as long as they sabotage enough to keep Trump busy. If Trump divulges the &quot;truth&quot; about JFK or any other &quot;secret&quot; document, he will read it only for &quot;good publicity&quot; not because he cares, so he will read any nonsense that is put in his hands without verification because it is simply not in his nature to take the seriousness that it deserves and verify that kind of information.<br /><br />They are the best example of &quot;when the good man does nothing.&quot;<br /><br />If they don&#039;t get to the bottom of the matter, there is no need to worry about them &quot;discovering something,&quot; it is just a matter of time and enough sabotage to resume the delay caused by their presence in the White House. And by wanting to sabotage Trump, they will end up shooting themselves in the foot. They are like those villains who never win and when they seem to succeed, their plans always fall apart naturally because they are their own saboteurs.<br /><br />I find it very interesting how the consortium has chosen him, it seems that they have put someone who does not dig deep enough to take care of the balance of necessary ignorance and avoid a greater mortality in regards to the agenda in Ukraine. The vassals have notably changed their actions once they were left without a boss to follow orders from.<br /><br />The FBI suspecting Trump without evidence? Did the FBI suspect Biden, Kamala or Obama and others for the attack on Trump? ... it is very obvious that the CIA and company are behind all this neighborhood self-terrorism.<br /><br />Now we will see new 9/11s.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Ok, Cass says it&#039;s &quot;difficult&quot; but they don&#039;t say it&#039;s &quot;impossible&quot; without hypnosis or with hypnosis alone.<br /><br />Taking into account that not everyone can have a hypnotherapist around the corner, is it possible that something can work similar to the liberating effect of hypnosis but in a natural way through experiences? Is it something that could only apply to a person with a certain degree of knowledge according to the level they are at and therefore, experience circumstances that can help that release of programming from an early age &quot;by themselves&quot;?</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote><br />Hypnotists don&#039;t need to be around the corner, IMO - it&#039;d probably be easy for anyone to find one who can offer sessions online.

On his website, Stillman specifically describes those supernatural qualities or abilities that an autistic individual possesses, including “a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature, forests, lakes, streams, and plant life”; an “innate spiritual or religious sense that compels others in positive ways”; an “unspoken connection with dogs, cats, horses, butterflies, and other creatures”; an ability to carry on “conversations that appear to be ‘two-way’ with someone invisible, usually in the same place and at the same time every day”; and an ability to “anticipate what will happen next or know what someone is thinking before they say it, especially with loved ones” (Stillman, “Demystifying Autism from the Inside Out”).<br /><br /><b><span style=\"font-size: 15px\">Autistic individuals are also endowed with “gifts of the Spirit” or the ability to know “what someone is thinking before they say it; predict future events that come true.</span></b></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote><br />Very close to telepathic/indigo children.

But one of the guys, I can&#039;t really remember the face of one of the guys, but he was, he had like no neck and he had like slicked back,  jet black hair that looked like super, super white.<br /><br /><b>Jay:</b> Yeah, and he was super white faced.<br /><br /><b>Hunter:</b> He was like really pale. And he had no neck and he kind of walked around like this. It was just very bizarre looking, but I didn&#039;t think anything of it. I was like, oh, just people coming into the restaurant to eat. But they went to the corner of the restaurant and they sat down and I remembered because my chair was like facing the corner and they would just, they kind of stared at us.<br /><br /><b>Jay: </b>They were staring at us, sucking our energy out.<br /><br /><b>Hunter: </b>And you know, when someone&#039;s staring at you, you don&#039;t like, you kind of just like, okay, whatever. And then, but they kept doing it. And then the guy that we were meeting with went in the bathroom and changed his shirt or something. We&#039;re like, what does this guy do? The guy that we were with, and you know, he was busy. He was trying to take phone calls and talk to us at the same time. And we&#039;re like, oh man, you&#039;re okay. You know, and he went in the bathroom and like changed his shirt - and we&#039;re like, why did he just change his shirt? We&#039;re like in a restaurant. And we&#039;re like, maybe he&#039;s just, you know having a bad day or whatever. And anyway, these guys, they kind of sit there and stare at us the whole time.<br /><br />And again, they have like, they&#039;re not, they&#039;re not people that you&#039;d see in that restaurant, but hey, you know, like anyone can go wherever. But they looked like they were in a biker gang, but they just, their shapes didn&#039;t look right. And they ambulated very weird. So when they were walking, it was kind of like this like side to sidewalk, almost like they didn&#039;t have an erect spine, you know, but it wasn&#039;t just that they were really fat. I don&#039;t know. They&#039;re almost like a jello person, if that makes sense.<br /><br />But during this time, you know, we&#039;re talking about business stuff and we&#039;re like, okay. I just didn&#039;t think anything of it. And then we go outside and they also go outside the exact same time as us. It&#039;s like, that&#039;s weird. These people came in and we were there for probably like an hour. Cause we were just, you know, eating. We go outside this exact same time and they just get in this like really big F-350 jacked up truck and then go away. And then when we were talking about it after, we were like, did you notice that? When they pulled out, they like, the truck turned, but it was like where there wasn&#039;t a turnout, if that makes sense?<br /><br /><b>Jay:</b> There was no way to get out and their truck just disappeared.<br /><br /><b>Hunter: </b>And it just disappeared. And so it was kind of one of those things when we talked about it later, it was very hazy to us. So like, I&#039;m reporting it back the best of my memory, but I usually don&#039;t have like hazy memories. I remember stuff even when I was a child, like very fresh, but it was just weird. And we didn&#039;t at the time, but we talked after realizing how bizarre it was because we kind of all felt we were in a haze in the restaurant.<br /><br /><b>Jay: </b>We were completely drained. Remember on the ride home? So a couple other things you left off that were insane was that we didn&#039;t realize until later is that I lost my ATM card and Bobby lost his license. And Laura, as the three of us were driving back to my home, the three of us literally were like, “I&#039;m so tired”. Like all three of us were like, I feel like we need to just pull over and take a nap.<br /><br />And we were super energized and had a really productive discussion while we were at this restaurant. But all three of us felt that, but as Hunter saying, we&#039;re talking about it now as if we knew what was going on, but we had no idea at the time. It was something that we thought about later because when we were all back home talking about how I lost my ATM card, the other guy who was potentially our business partner lost his license, which he never recovered.<br /><br /><b>Hunter: </b>He never found his license either and he didn&#039;t take it out while he was there or anything - he didn&#039;t take it out at all.<br /><br /><b>Jay: </b> It was the most insane weird thing, but we were sitting there and then all of us just like, like it almost as if it was implanted in our minds. We started talking about the guys and we&#039;re like, &quot;weren&#039;t they the most bizarre&quot;? Like what really happened? But the thing that freaked me out because I was the one driving and when we tried to leave the parking lot, we let them go because they backed out in front of us, still of course, staring at us. And then they went and as Hunter said, they had this giant jacked up truck. They went straight. And then we started talking amongst ourselves and you know, it was kind of like, okay, I&#039;m gonna let this guy go and then I&#039;ll go - and so I went out to follow him but when I went to follow him, we realized because we were in a place that we had never been before in St. Petersburg. We&#039;re like, there&#039;s no exit.<br /><br />And then all three of us are like, where did that truck go? Like what? But then we were just kind of like, oh, we must&#039;ve just lost track of it or whatever. But I&#039;m serious. Like all three of us were in a serious haze. We had our energy drained, which obviously as you know, is what happens when you deal with these beings.<br /><br /><br /><b>[different story, but still about Men in Black, Jay continues immediately after one above]:<br />Jay: </b>Something else I was gonna tell you that, cause you brought it up about Bender. There&#039;s a documentary on Netflix right now. And when you or Hunter start talking again, I&#039;ll research and pull it up. But it&#039;s in the top like 15 shows on Netflix right now. It&#039;s a documentary. I forget what it&#039;s called. I think it&#039;s “something phenomenon”, but they interview a guy who was, who witnessed an anomalous triangle in the UK. And it&#039;s like 20 plus years ago.<br /><br />And it wasn&#039;t a guy, it was two cooks. And they were working in this restaurant and they had taken their time off. It was a break or whatever. They went out into the field where they observed this. And it was, this is a very known phenomenon that happened like over 20 years ago, but they obviously reopened the investigation for this documentary. But then they interviewed a guy who worked with the two. He said they were visited by <b>men in black</b>. And as soon as the men in black visited them, that that was it. They were never seen from again.<br /><br />That they literally never showed back up at the restaurant. And he said that all the people that worked in the kitchen, cause they were all like a family, were freaked out about it because they had never ever heard from again. That their house, they were basically just reported as missing persons. And I&#039;ll find out what that documentary is so you guys can all watch it. But they interviewed the guy who was friends of them. And it was bizarre because as he said, the men in black, I was like, well, here we go again.  It&#039;s another example. But he also mentioned that when they came to the restaurant to interview the two cooks that were actually out there that actually witnessed this anomalous UFO or UAP, that everyone in the restaurant felt drained after. And that they felt like they had like lost life force energy.<br /><br />And this guy was not like one of us. He was completely just a normal person. He didn&#039;t understand any of this kind of stuff, but his message - and so it just triggered me instantly. I was like, well, here&#039;s another example of what men in black do when they show up.<br /><br /><b>Laura:</b> Well, the draining of energy seems to be one really common factor. It&#039;s like I said, they&#039;re parasites. And I think, who was it? Maybe it was Colin Wilson. I&#039;m not sure. I don&#039;t want to misattribute it. But there was a book called The Mind Parasites. And it was one of the closest things to the dynamic of the hyperdimensional beings.... And it was just like a really bizarre story. But, as I look at the world today, it&#039;s like this sort of thing is rampant. You know, strange. I mean, there&#039;ve been some videos shown on X of strange people in the US Congress, like somebody in the background. Just really strange.<br /><br />And then, of course, before that, there&#039;ve been many, many videos of people behaving in these really odd ways with those. And the story of the woman on the airplane who said that she got off the airplane because the guy was not human [not real]. This kind of stuff, it goes on constantly, continuously. And, you know, for years it was all damped down and, you know, covered over, shoved under the rug, because it just, it wasn&#039;t acceptable. It&#039;s like, Coulthart says, you know, when you&#039;re in the news business, you know that, you know, this sort of stuff is treated with complete disdain.</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":4888,"user":"Alma.Innovadora","id":1231377,"date":"2025-02-07T03:52:38+0100","text":"<blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 7512\" data-quote=\"Gwenllian\" data-source=\"post: 1231350\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1231350\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1231350\">Gwenllian said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">Or maybe we just have to be content when we can reach little bits of the subconscious mind or at least understand why we react in a certain way and subsequently, learn new behaviour/beliefs?</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote><br />I often think that perhaps that is the &quot;price to pay&quot; for gaining all this prior knowledge before the experience.

A few days ago while I was speaking honestly at a work meeting, where I wanted to leave my specific points, my body began to tremble abruptly, like a nervous breakdown, it was strange because it was nothing different from what I had not faced before. Maybe it was the particular people who activated the program of being submissive and silent, but I didn&#039;t do it, I took a deep breath and continued with what I had to say against that automated response of my body and I felt very good when I finished. I felt like a great weight was lifted off my shoulders and as I spoke, I was more confident in what I was saying, in my gestures, in the clarity with which I spoke so as not to leave interpretations up in the air on the part of those listening, it was liberating.<br /><br />I remembered that as a child I couldn&#039;t express what I felt or thought, only adults were right about everything and emotions were repressed. So it was interesting to feel that uncomfortable feeling again.","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":10471,"user":"Fluffy","id":1231378,"date":"2025-02-07T04:06:21+0100","text":"<blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 9769\" data-quote=\"Altair\" data-source=\"post: 1231302\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1231302\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1231302\">Altair said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">This seems to contradict this response:<br /><br /><br />I&#039;m wondering, what would be the point of transporting a person (or her soul) via such lift from 3D to 5D?</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>I had this idea a few weeks ago that when/if the aliens show up they might offer things like visiting deceased loved ones to sway a persons’ opinion of if they are good aliens or not. <br />May be they take people to 5D to implant screen memories and things as such. 5D is, from my understanding, whatever we <i>dream</i> it to be.","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":11665,"user":"Il Matto","id":1231489,"date":"2025-02-07T19:48:21+0100","text":"<blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 10471\" data-quote=\"Fluffy\" data-source=\"post: 1231378\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1231378\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1231378\">Fluffy said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">I had this idea a few weeks ago that <b>when/if the aliens show up they might offer things like visiting deceased loved ones to sway a persons’ opinion of if they are good aliens or not.<br />May be they take people to 5D to implant screen memories and things as such</b>. 5D is, from my understanding, whatever we <i>dream</i> it to be.</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>An interesting idea - showing &#039;signs and wonders&#039;

Now, something often referred to in your terminology as a silver thread, is like a closed line which opens when this conduit is needed. That&#039;s rather awkward, but it&#039;s the only way to describe it. So that when the physical body terminates, this line is opened forming a conduit through which the soul passes naturally. <b>However, part of the existence of this conduit is that it is absolutely impenetrable by any force from any density level.</b> Therefore, <b>souls in the process of transferring from third density to fifth density are not in any way able to be molested or tampered with.</b> And it should be mentioned here, also, that the soul imprint of the physical body always has a connection to fifth density and that is through the so-called &quot;silver thread.&quot; That always exists as the third density soul&#039;s doorway to fifth density. It can be opened at a moment&#039;s notice whenever needed. When it is opened it becomes a conduit. Through that conduit the soul passes. And it is not subject to interference by anything. This is not a deliberate construction, it is merely the natural process similar to what could be described as the protection mechanisms existing on second level density for creatures which are not capable of protecting themselves through their own conscious thought processes. For example, your turtle is contained within a shell that protects it. That shell is impenetrable by any natural forces, therefore nothing that is natural can harm that turtle. However, the same can exist for any creature when it is connected by the silver thread to fifth density. Once it is passing through the conduit produced by the opening of the silver thread, then, of course, it cannot be tampered with.

It is where we examine our lives as projected slides and baf! we make them &quot;real&quot;. Symbolically it has been given the name of &quot;zone of regret&quot; or &quot;purgatory&quot;, so it is not far-fetched that in order to examine our experiences, they manifest and we must live them included with the rest of our past lives.<br /><br />That it can be accessed from 3D without having to leave the physical body does not seem impossible to me, is there really room to use &quot;impossible&quot;? Should we still be talking about &quot;impossible&quot;? If something &quot;cannot be done&quot; it is because it violates free will or because it does not apply in a density or because one does not have the knowledge for something in particular because one is not in the density to have it, but impossible? I have discarded that word definitively because nothing is limited, only our 3D perception and thinking makes us see &quot;limits&quot; because we are talking about beings who know how to decompose and recompose matter, how to combine it with the components that make up the physical and ethereal part of the present components of some density according to the &quot;laws&quot; that make it up and somehow protect a 3D body from those &quot;structural laws&quot; and make them &quot;compatible&quot; with an environment contrary to the one it is made of or momentarily exchange them to a body where it can function in a certain density, so to speak. For God&#039;s sake, they can take the soul out of our bodies, that&#039;s already a lot with too much (laughs).<br /><br />Ok, &quot;there are other ways to access 4D and 5D&quot; makes me think then that it is not strictly physical nor strictly ethereal.<br /><br />There are natural processes in existence that cannot be manipulated in any way, and that is understandable. But it is not that they cannot come here, it is that it takes a lot of energy to do so, so it is more profitable to order a delivery to work better &quot;up there&quot; (laughter) where the &quot;resources&quot; and conditions of density are more favorable.<br /><br />But then, is there a &quot;contemplation zone&quot; in the 5th density or is the entire density a contemplation zone? I do not remember that it has been mentioned that the 5th density has been described as an &quot;ethereal density&quot; but it is where &quot;ethereal souls&quot; are worked on punctually and that is impregnable  by any being of any density. But what is around? Is there something beyond the &quot;veil&quot; where the so-called &quot;contemplation zone&quot; takes place?<br /><br />If these beings can reach 5D in &quot;other ways&quot; and carry other people in their 3D bodies or exchange them from one 3D body to another more suitable body using their latest generation elevators for higher densities, which seems most appropriate, then it is a 5D zone, apart from the &quot;contemplation zone&quot; through which they can &quot;transit&quot;.<br /><br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"\" data-quote=\"\" data-source=\"\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \"><span style=\"font-size: 15px\">Q: (L) [...] so these bases may be places that if you are taken to them, are in them, that through these portals, or trans-density bases, you are thereby able to transit the densities?<br /></span><br /><b><span style=\"font-size: 15px\">A: You are able anyway.</span></b></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote><br />I don&#039;t know if the translation is helping me but it&#039;s like saying &quot;with or without an elevator, you can do it anyway&quot; is one of &quot;many ways&quot;.","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":19873,"user":"Ricardo","id":1231575,"date":"2025-02-08T07:52:09+0100","text":"Some confusion regarding 5D , in the last couple of posts , contemplation zone for  &quot;lower &quot; densities both sto and sts ,  part of all that is , no sts tech to access it .Image below from Wave 3 page 334.<br /><a href=\"https://cassiopaea.org/forum/attachments/tree-density-png.105727/\"target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://cassiopaea.org/forum/data/attachments/88/88890-b8db2a6fdfacfe07b9f0eb6a485c4351.jpg?hash=Q9verCDs72\"class=\"bbImage \"style=\"\"alt=\"tree-density.png\"title=\"tree-density.png\"width=\"133\" height=\"100\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a>","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":19873,"user":"Ricardo","id":1231579,"date":"2025-02-08T08:09:36+0100","text":"(cont .)

I couldn&#039;t come up with the word(s) to find the session.<br /><br />In quite a few books they do mention a place on the other side of the veil (5D) where those who, for want of a better term, are evil reside.

So there&#039;s a spectrum. And then I pointed out that we should imagine that we have a similar spectrum in 3D, so that we have from the lowest level human looking beings that are just barely amoebas, so to speak. They may be without souls or without individuated souls as we consider higher level humans to have. But there&#039;s also not just a unidirectional or vertical spectrum, there&#039;s also probably a mosaic spectrum, all kinds of different beings and types of beings and levels of beings and abilities of beings and all of the uniqueness of the types and so forth. And the next thing that we should also naturally assume, I mean if we&#039;re considering our hermetic maxims being of any use is that 4D similarly has a spectrum - and not just a vertical spectrum, but a mosaic spectrum of all kinds of beings and creatures, and that they can do all kinds of things. Having said that, there is a possibility at some higher level or in some narrow category of 4D beings, there are those who can at least with their inner self - assuming that 4D beings have inner selves - can enter and exit 5D, maybe at will. And a whole bunch of &#039;em can&#039;t, except in the sense that we possibly do…<br /><br />(Joe) Who would want to?<br /><br />(L) Yeah, I&#039;m not sure, but I remember what&#039;s his name, Michael Topper. And I&#039;m pretty sure, I think I referenced it in my article on stalking - Michael Topper, stalking - that a 5D STS being was incredibly contractile, gravitation… I mean, you would think of it as the laziest thing on the planet because it&#039;s so contractile, it doesn&#039;t even move. It doesn&#039;t even stir… I mean, almost like a black hole, and maybe it&#039;s close to a black hole. Maybe that&#039;s what black holes are: they are these contractile 5D STS beings floating around in the universe. Maybe the universe is 5D for all we know.<br /><br />(Joe) So you&#039;ve got physical existence, human beings, 4D, whatever, semi-physical, whatever. There&#039;s a lifespan. We see it as human beings. We see it as pretty short. And then after that, you go with 5D and you spend however long, and then 5D&#039;s a contemplation zone. So you get to 5D and do your contemplating for as long as you want, as long as you choose maybe, right?<br /><br />(L) Or however long you need.<br /><br />(...)","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":18191,"user":"Uperios","id":1231764,"date":"2025-02-09T10:30:15+0100","text":"Thank you all! for making available this session. <br />Interesting start of the 2025 and most probably will get more and more interesting<img src=\"/forum/styles/cass/smilies/umm.gif\"  class=\"smilie\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\":umm:\" title=\"Um...    :umm:\" data-shortname=\":umm:\" />","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":11531,"user":"Seato","id":1231854,"date":"2025-02-09T20:16:00+0100","text":"Thank you for this session.<br />Things seems to be unfolding very quickly now especially in the USA. &quot;Feets don&#039;t fail me now&quot; certainly feels appropriate.","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":13209,"user":"findhome","id":1232017,"date":"2025-02-10T16:55:08+0100","text":"new ufo over sakhalin island<br /><div class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--unfurl    js-unfurl fauxBlockLink\"data-unfurl=\"true\" data-result-id=\"230122\" data-url=\"https://www.yaplakal.com/forum28/topic2891909.html\" data-host=\"www.yaplakal.com\" data-pending=\"false\"><div class=\"contentRow\"><div class=\"contentRow-main\"><h3 class=\"contentRow-header js-unfurl-title\"><a href=\"https://www.yaplakal.com/forum28/topic2891909.html\"class=\"link link--external fauxBlockLink-blockLink\"target=\"_blank\"rel=\"nofollow ugc noopener\"data-proxy-href=\"\">НЛО над Сахалином - ЯПлакалъ</a></h3><div class=\"contentRow-snippet js-unfurl-desc\">НЛО в форме диска над Сахалином наделало шуму в Сети  Интернет-издание NewsFrol рассказало о неопознанном летающем объекте в форме диска, замеченным над горами Сахалина.

Anyone intending to flee would have done so long ago, particularly in the early years when Damascus faced near siege, daily bombardment, and the constant threat of terrorists reaching its centre.<br /><br />Before everything unfolded, I travelled from Damascus to Moscow on November 20 via Cham Wings Airlines to defend my doctoral dissertation on November 29. At the time, my mother was in Moscow following a bone marrow transplant she had undergone at the end of summer, which required isolation as part of her treatment. I had planned to stay longer after my defence to complete certain certification procedures, but as the situation in Syria deteriorated, I returned to Damascus on Sunday, December 1, aboard Syrian Air to be with my father and brother, Karim. My mother remained in Moscow to continue her treatment, with my sister, Zein, staying by her side.<br /><br />Regarding the events of Saturday, December 7, and Sunday, December 8: On Saturday morning, my brother sat for a mathematics exam at the Higher Institute for Applied Sciences and Technology in Damascus, where he was studying. He was preparing to resume classes the next day. Meanwhile, my sister had booked a ticket to return to Damascus on Sunday, December 8, aboard Syrian Air.<br /><br />On Saturday afternoon, rumours began circulating that we had fled the country. Several people reached out to confirm whether we were still in Damascus. In response, I took a picture at Al-Nairabain Park in Al-Muhajireen neighbourhood and shared it on my (now closed) private Instagram. Not long after, some social media pages picked up the picture and began circulating it.<br /><br /><b>Until then, despite the distant sounds of shelling, nothing seemed unusual—just the familiar reality we had grown accustomed to since the early years of the war. The situation remained unchanged as the army prepared to defend Damascus, showing no signs of the subsequent deterioration—until the sudden and unexpected news of the army’s withdrawal from Homs, mirroring earlier withdrawals from Hama, Aleppo, and Idlib countryside. Even then, there were no preparations for departure, nor any indication that we would be leaving. That changed after midnight when a Russian official arrived at our home in Al-Malki neighbourhood. He conveyed a request for the President to relocate to Latakia for a few days due to the severity of the situation in Damascus and to facilitate the oversight of the battles, which were still ongoing on the coastal and Al-Ghab Plain fronts.</b><br /><br />As for the claim that we left without informing my cousins, who were in Damascus at the time, I was the one who called them multiple times as soon as we knew we were relocating. Shortly afterward, we learned from their household staff that they had left for an unknown destination.<br /><br />After a short time, we headed toward Damascus International Airport, arriving around 3a.m., where we were joined by my uncle, Maher. We found the airport deserted, with no staff present, including at the control tower. We then boarded a Russian military aircraft to Latakia, landing at Hmeimim Airport before dawn.<br /><br />In the early hours of Sunday morning, we were supposed to head to the presidential retreat in the Burj Islam area, which is over 40 kilometres from the airport by road. However, all attempts to reach anyone there were unsuccessful, as every phone we tried was turned off. We soon began receiving reports of military withdrawals from the frontlines, and the fall of the last remaining positions. At the same time, a series of drone attacks began targeting the base, accompanied by both close and distant gunfire in the surrounding area; this situation continued throughout our stay.<br /><br />In the afternoon, the base command briefed us on the gravity of the situation nearby. They informed us that leaving the base was no longer an option, as terrorists had spread through the country, the situation had descended into chaos, and all communication with military leadership had been lost. After consulting with Moscow, the base command informed us that our transfer to Russia had been requested. Some-time after, we boarded a Russian military aircraft bound for Moscow, where we landed later that night.</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":19544,"user":"meadow_wind","id":1232032,"date":"2025-02-10T18:31:47+0100","text":"<blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 14284\" data-quote=\"iamthatis\" data-source=\"post: 1231156\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1231156\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1231156\">iamthatis said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">Hypnotists don&#039;t need to be around the corner, IMO - it&#039;d probably be easy for anyone to find one who can offer sessions online.

Please note that I no longer offer this service. <br /><br />The Ordre des Psychologues du Québec has advised me that services of spiritual regression, including past life and/or in-between lives, can only be given by Psychologists, Psychotherapists or medical Doctors in Quebec.  As I am not a Psychologist, Psychotherapist or medical Doctor, I cannot offer that service in Quebec. <br />You might be able to find a Psychologist, Psychotherapist or medical Doctor who offer the service of spiritual regression, however I am not personally aware of any that do.<br />Furthermore, the Ordre des Psychologues du Québec wishes to advise the general public that the practice of spiritual regression is not based on science and can be dangerous, as well, they do not recommend that the public use this service, even if given by a Psychologist, Psychotherapist or medical Doctor.<br /><br />The above does not reflect my personal opinion, but is based on the ruling written by the Ordre des Psychologues du Québec.</i><br /><br />I replied to her and she said:<br /><i>I appreciate your frustration! I am equally frustrated and concerned that in Quebec people will not be able to get the help they want. No other place, that I know of, has the same restrictions on past life regression as we do here.</i>","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":14284,"user":"iamthatis","id":1232046,"date":"2025-02-10T20:04:19+0100","text":"<blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 19544\" data-quote=\"meadow_wind\" data-source=\"post: 1232032\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1232032\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1232032\">meadow_wind said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">I would also be interested in knowing if one must attend in person or if online is ok.

OK,<br /><br />A: No.<br /><br />Q: (L) I&#039;ll tell you, hold on. </b>One of the things that came through: it was the session when I was asking questions about [my son&#039;s] experiences under hypnosis, so it was back fairly early on. And I asked a series of questions about what he perceived. Now, he had an alien abduction experience that he described in another lifetime, seemingly. He described what amounted to having this screen thing put over his face, and the red dots, and the programming and the beings in the silver robes standing around, and then being shunted through this tunnel, and finding himself in this dark space where there were all these black-hole things all around him. <b>I asked, was this an alien abduction in another lifetime and they said no, it was a fifth density life review. I said, are some of these beings we perceive as aliens, and some of these experiences we perceive as alien abductions, actually events or experiences on fifth density? And they said yes.</b><br /><br />(J) Life review... that&#039;s real important.<br /><br /><b>(L) Right. So what they&#039;re saying is, and when they&#039;re talking about taking souls on the battlefield, and so forth, obviously we have fifth density &quot;alien&quot; and they&#039;ve said that the term is used loosely. I mean, we might perceive them as alien, but they were fifth density workers, so to speak. That was their job, to do whatever it was they did, or they perceived it as their job. So that, to have these bases transit the densities up through fifth, would make perfect sense because of the kind of work they&#039;re doing. Is that...<br /><br />A:</b> There is so much extremely vital stuff about this subject, that it would be wise to stay with it until completion.<br /><br /><b>Q:</b> (T) We plan on staying with it, we&#039;re trying to understand this...<br /><br />(L) You remember when my brother was here, they kept wanting us to come back to the subject of the bases. And we didn&#039;t, we wandered off.<br /><br />(T) Our problem is, we wander a lot of the time. We&#039;re worse than Carl Sagan as a group here. We wander off on tangent ideas, and go from one thing to the next. We never stay on a subject. OK, the bases are trans-density bases; they go from the third density to the fifth; they exist in the third, fourth and fifth density all at the same time, is this correct so far?<br /><br /><b>A:</b> Close.<br /><br /><b>Q:</b> (T) Now, when a being, a soul, whatever, is in the base, do they exist in all three densities at the same time?<br /><br /><b>A:</b> No.<br /><br /><b>Q:</b> (L) Hold on, I&#039;ve got an idea...<br /><br /><b>A:</b> When you are in a skyscraper, do you exist on all floors at the same time?<br /><br /><b>Q: </b>(J) No, but you have got to know where the elevator is! <b>(L) Is there something like an elevator that can move you, if you&#039;re in these locations, from one density to another, and experience these bases, these trans-density bases, at different levels?<br /><br />A: It is an elevator!</b></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":9769,"user":"Altair","id":1233377,"date":"2025-02-18T10:19:00+0100","text":"<blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 1789\" data-quote=\"axj\" data-source=\"post: 1233376\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1233376\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1233376\">axj said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">The topic of elevators from 3D to 5D came up before in 1995:</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>Yes, that was the first time the C&#039;s mentioned these elevators.","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":1789,"user":"axj","id":1233378,"date":"2025-02-18T10:23:40+0100","text":"<blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 9769\" data-quote=\"Altair\" data-source=\"post: 1233377\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1233377\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1233377\">Altair said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">Yes, that was the first time the C&#039;s mentioned these elevators.</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>Sorry, just saw that this 1995 session was actually directly referenced in the current session.<br /><br />The session from September last year had similar topics too:<br /><br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"\" data-quote=\"\" data-source=\"\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">Session Date: September 21st 2024<br /><br />(L) Yeah, I wouldn&#039;t want to do that.

He always gets these questions: <b>&quot;Can some 4D beings enter at will the 5D environment without dying?&quot;</b> Which is similar to the question that you were asking. Well, I guess they can in that way, but they cannot, I would say that they would be restricted from entering it with their full sensorium because that would be prevented because the part of them that is connected to it would be able to enter.

You suggested that there are certain STS forces who are developing or creating or managing physical bodies that they are trying to increase the frequency in so that they will have bodies that are wired so that they can manifest directly into 3rd density, since that seems to be the real barrier that prevents an all-out invasion, the fact that we are in 3rd density and they are in 4th. Now, I assumed that the same function could be true for STO individuals. It seems that many individuals who have come into this time period from the future, coming back into the past via the incarnational cycle so as not to violate free will, have carefully selected bodies with particular DNA, which they are, little by little, activating so that there 4th density selves, or higher, can manifest in this reality. Is it possible for those energies to manifest into such bodies which have been awakened or tuned in 3rd density?<br /><br /><span style=\"color: rgb(41, 105, 176)\">A: STO tends to do the process within the natural flow of things.

Can that be STO?<br /><br />A: It is not, because that is not STO.<br /><br />Q: So, when that is happening, and if it is happening, it is occurring in the STS parameter?<br /><br />A: Yes.<br /><br />Q: How do the STO manage?<br /><br />A: They do not concern themselves with such things.<br /><br />Q: Well, if the STS guys are genetically tweaking themselves to have some kind of different outcome for some reason that we do not perceive, don&#039;t you think there should be a balancing action on the STO side of some sort?<br /><br />A: You are thinking in STS terms.

In fact, that is the style and manner of behavior of STS, that they do not accept or respect natural processes.<br />But I think Hlat is referring to something else and, if that is what I think he is referring to, I agree with him. I haven&#039;t found the contradiction either.<br /><br />As I interpret it, not being able to abduct 5D souls and interfere with their processes, refers to those who are in the zone of contemplation and who have arrived there through the inner conduit of the silver thread, which opens when the physical body has ceased, thus providing a safe journey to an equally safe place for the soul. That is, to a specific zone of 5D.<br /><br />That does not mean that to other zones of the 5D, 3D people can not be taken, for whatever.<br />And in that case we would be talking about 3D beings kidnapped and not 5D beings kidnapped.<br />It is in that sense that I do not find contradiction between those two answers of C.<br /> <br /><br />Precisely, they do this with people who are incarnated and then have living, or active, or functional physical bodies. A very tempting booty for 4D STS, who do not mind violating the free will of the souls who legitimately occupy those bodies for their 3D life.<br /><br />This comment about the apparent contradiction but which may not be, is because I am considering something very interesting raised by Innovative Soul:<br /><br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 4888\" data-quote=\"Alma.Innovadora\" data-source=\"post: 1231573\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1231573\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1231573\">Alma.Innovadora said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">But then, is there a &quot;contemplation zone&quot; in the 5th density or is the entire density a contemplation zone?

I&#039;ve been trying to find information on this for a while now. But it seems that the information is a bit scarce on this. I know a lot of this information is outside of us. I&#039;m sure if ETs and Cs release more information about this. It could violate free well or cause unnecessary fear about the full process. Instead of giving us a summary.<br /><br />I&#039;ve been trying to look into how our dense physical bodies need to adjust to be in 5D. I&#039;m aware that most people have light bodies. But don&#039;t we need to go to upper 4D first even before we go to 5D? The big jump from 3D to 5D seems to much of a big jumper. As I have read that we are going to upper 4D as a pit stop before moving up to 5D. <br /><br />Then comes the other question, do we need to dump our physicals, but this also doesn&#039;t make much sense as we go back to 5D anyway when we leave our bodies. Then it comes to the topic that people have been talking about with these high tech elevators. I know if this technology exists it will be way beyond out understanding. But it still has to come down to, how will our bodies adjust to the new very high levels of energy.  Everything I have read is that without proper adjusting to these energy levels, our physical bodies will degrade at a very fast rate, so it has to be a very slow process. But as I understand, energy levels are slowly raising on the planet for a while now. But is it enough for 5D or upper 4D? If you look at other ETs around both 3D and 4D still have physical bodies. But the bodies are customed to the environment already. 5D and above have light bodies but can form a body but gets harder the higher D you go. <br /><br />There is so little information around on how the process works in detail. I have also come across information that Earth a few other 3D worlds in our galaxy are also in the same process this time around. <br /><br />To make it final. Yes, we are entering a very unique time. Earth is being watched by many higher dimensional beings. As they see this a very interesting period. All eyes are on Earth to see how we will get though this interesting and fun time as they see it. As from what I have learnt, the whole planet and solar system with everyone on them will be ascending as a whole. First time this is happening on a grand scale. <br /><br />But I do still get the odd dream or 2. That I might be interacting with different ETs in the future with either a light body or physical. My last dream with a ET was a humanoid canine-wolf being, from what I remember talking was both vocal and telepathy.","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":9535,"user":"daddycat","id":1233679,"date":"2025-02-20T09:04:50+0100","text":"<blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 20224\" data-quote=\"benklerk\" data-source=\"post: 1233612\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1233612\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1233612\">benklerk said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">I&#039;ve been trying to look into how our dense physical bodies need to adjust to be in 5D.</div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandLink js-expandLink\"><a role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\">Click to expand...</a></div></div></blockquote>There&#039;s no adjustment in the natural way, when people die and go straight to 5D and the bodies are left behind.","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":14181,"user":"Wandering Star","id":1233713,"date":"2025-02-20T12:19:30+0100","text":"A session that can perhaps be related to the famous elevator.<br /><br /><blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 17\" data-quote=\"Laura\" data-source=\"post: 496610\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=496610\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-496610\">Laura said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">Q: (L) Proper technology.

Very interesting question indeed.<br />I suppose the motives or reasons could be diverse.<br />Right now I am thinking about one of those possible reasons, of course totally speculating.<br /><br />One of many other things that 4D STS does, is to be modifying and tinkering with the 3D physical bodies, in order to maintain their dominance and/or nourishment.<br /><br />Possibly, the fact that while a person is incarnated they are connected (through the silver thread) to their physical body, could be a fundamental detail and, something that 4D STS needs to solve. And it solves it with this advanced technology.<br /><br />To understand what I mean, I need to expand a little.<br />There is a well-known natural phenomenon. When we are sleeping or even in some state close to that sometimes, while our physical body is resting, a certain non-physical part of us can go for a walk, so to speak.<br />The detail is that even though we are walking around without our physical bodies, we are nonetheless connected to it by means of the silver cord.<br /><br /><br /><br />In this natural situation, although the physical body is resting, it is still somehow sensing and reading the physical environment in which it finds itself. And in the event that it senses that something is wrong, such as a sudden change in environmental temperature, gusts of wind, sudden noises, or whatever makes it feel that there is some danger, it will immediately call the part of our consciousness that is wandering around, and this will immediately return to the body, thus reestablishing the capacity for action in a physical environment. That is, you will be able to move again, prepare breakfast, kick someone&#039;s butt who is trying to harm your body <img src=\"/forum/styles/cass/smilies/wink.gif\"  class=\"smilie\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\";-)\" title=\"Wink    ;-)\" data-shortname=\";-)\" />, etc.<br />(This call is by a sort of tug on the silver thread, which as we said, while we are incarnated this thread keeps us connected to our physical bodies).<br /><br />My main suspicion is that this, what I have called “capacity of action”, is the obstacle that 4 STS faces when they want to do certain manipulations or use for something, living physical bodies of living people. And to overcome that obstacle they use advanced technology.<br />In short, what they need to achieve is that the physical body cannot warn the rightful owner or occupant of the physical body that something very bad is happening. And this they must do without the silver thread of the individual being opened.<br /><br /><br /><br />Perhaps, what they take somewhere in 5D is the non-physical part of the individual, leaving him floating around for a while, momentarily cut off from his body, for the duration of the utilization or intervention of that physical body. The latter could consist of attaching information to the molecules of that body.<br />Then they return the non-physical part they had set aside, reuniting it to the modified or simply used body.<br /> <br /><br />This part of the speculation is as to “why they do it”.<br />The next thing is as to “how they do it”.<br /><br />I am thinking that a physical body is made up of a bunch of molecules, organized, associated, communicating with each other, etc. <br />The particular association of these atomic particles, grouped together and transmitting information to each other, form a particular or unique physical body.<br />These molecules stay together forming a particular group (body), due to the particular information that associates them. This information also includes the experiences of the individual.<br /><br />Now let&#039;s think of a technology that manages to separate these molecules and, at another time, put them back together again.<br />A clue could be something that Wandering Star quoted that the Cas said:<br />“ Gravity unites all that is physical with all that is ethereal through unstable gravitational waves! ”<br /><br /><br /><br />If the molecules of a body are held together due to the binding and associative information they possess, then the separation of these molecules can be achieved by detaching the information they possess or is attached to these molecules. I am referring to detaching information paid to the molecule.<br /><br />Here I am considering the molecules as the physical and the information as the ethereal. Do you understand what I am saying?<br />A molecule temporarily stripped of information, loses the link it might have with another molecule, i.e., the factor that held them together is not present and thus, they separate.<br /><br />I am asking myself some questions.<br />We always hear and think about electromagnetic fields involved, in this matter of molecular separation, remolecularization, etc., but the truth is that we have many questions in that regard.<br /><br />For example:<br />Following the reasoning above, where I put molecules as the physical and information as the ethereal. And, that the Cas said that the physical and the ethereal come together through unstable gravitational waves, then I wonder:<br />Could the separation be through STABLE gravitational waves?<br />Would this advanced technology have anything to do with stabilizing gravitational waves? <img class=\"smilie smilie--emoji\" alt=\"🤔\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f914.png\" title=\"Thinking face    :thinking:\" data-shortname=\":thinking:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" /><br /><br />Translated with DeepL.com (free version)","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":19148,"user":"Happy Poo","id":1235044,"date":"2025-02-28T20:58:19+0100","text":"A belated Thank you very much for the January session <img class=\"smilie smilie--emoji\" alt=\"❤️\" src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/2764.png\" title=\"Red heart    :heart:\" data-shortname=\":heart:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"64\" height=\"64\" />","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":10359,"user":"Professor Chaos","id":1235569,"date":"2025-03-03T14:21:05+0100","text":"<blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 3628\" data-quote=\"mantle\" data-source=\"post: 1229732\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1229732\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1229732\">mantle said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \">Mother ships , smaller ships , round orbs , round saucers ,egg shaped, tear drops , oval shaped, triangles, boomerangs and arrow heads, cloud cigars , probes , in shades of  silver red dotted , luminous grey , translucent , metal hard black,  floating, eerily silent, skimming on oceans, changing into impossible speeds , drones, drones,.... they have always been here, same same but only different this time.

That is funny, isn&#039;t it?<br /><br />By the way, 3.5 sucks, it has imprinted political correctness and makes a lot of mistakes, kind of like a student trying to pretend having knowledge or having limited knowledge and using round words. It even pretends knowing things - simply making up facts and pretending it was research. Using it I felt like it was used to manipulate dumb, like keeping them in a sleep. But fortunately not everyone is dumb - 4.o is already decent. Of course, it can mislead you, but it became useful. More professional if to say so. There are side effects, though.<br /><br />Google has already taught people to search for everything possible. In general, the network&#039;s operation causes something similar to ADD (attention deficit disorder). It&#039;s not the same as the old, analog &quot;zapping&quot; of television. Although even then, advertisements strained neurons with their tempo and music. (Today, the TV mechanism is different - from a media studies perspective, stress is pumped into people, e.g., through infotainment and crime porn, to later sell products as cures for stress. Adrenaline is addictive but must be reduced later. It&#039;s a kind of media speedball).<br /><br />You can take notes and have your spelling checked right away, translate automatically, and check information by clicking. Of course, this replaces your normal brain function. It speeds it up a bit, a bit like cheating. I don&#039;t know; there is a subconscious, a thought process, but it&#039;s probably like working out in a gym with some light accelerators. The Cassiopaeans have already suggested &quot;thinking XYZ&quot; instead of &quot;Googling XYZ.&quot;<br /><br />I think Internet impacts our use of short-term and long-term memory. Besides, the network largely reflects our neurons, which is why people often lock themselves in their network of neuronal associations, somewhat tamed by the simplified and prosaic media message of people who know how to use it (of course, mainly for financial purposes). But on the other hand, more intelligent people learn faster, exchange information, and are not as susceptible to influence. When they fall into a thought bubble (e.g., socio-political worldview) - it no longer takes them years or decades to work it out; sometimes months are enough.<br /><br />What was considered conspiracy theories (the so-called &quot;yellow caps&quot; from old YouTube videos or &quot;silver hats&quot;) - for many people, also of high social status and objectively intelligent, is information to consider.<br /><br />After all, we also used encyclopedias, dictionaries, books. Maybe it was simply more at the pace of our brain than the computer? More thoughtful. Then again, we use computers ourselves and we keep up because we use it at our own pace, in our own ways. We can use the computer for research and communication, or for artistic expression, not just funny videos, at our own pace, in our own way. However, at some point the channeling sessions advised us against using the network (as well as using AI, and yet... our curiosity and sense of freedom prevail).<br /><br />I recently watched a program from the 80s, where people who actually died in an accident later, based on simple electronic devices, predicted the emergence of the &quot;technological man.&quot; Maybe not to the extent of Johnny Mnemonic. But basically predicting the mass use of technology, access to information, personal freedom built on it, and, to some extent, the network. I think it is irreversible unless there is a global catalyst. That was AI with some worldview imprinted, with some... thinking. In that sense, it could actually be part of a supervised evolution program, if we look at it from that perspective. If there was a cataclysm, like a global war, there is Starlink. The network was predicted to be indestructible, because it is decentralized - individual transmitters or servers will not shut down the network. Although in the Matrix, there was also an electromagnetic signal that destroyed devices.<br /><br />Either way, Google is currently losing its importance. It has stopped in time a bit - it overtook website directories, but it did not keep up with AI, and in addition it promoted useless, advertised content, being susceptible to spam. I predict that within a year it will turn into an Application similar to GPT or Grok; otherwise, people will start to use such applications instead of Google instinctively.<br /><br />As we have already said, the introduction of paid apps would probably destroy the Web, or limit it to &quot;pseudo-elites,&quot; who, however, always need an audience, whether for narcissistic reasons or for profit. So it probably won&#039;t happen; besides, paying for a subscription or additional options has only partially caught on.<br /><br />I think we don&#039;t have to predict the worst right away. Although we are at a point where it is hard to predict what will happen next. For about 100 years, the world looked pretty much the same. It developed at a multi-year pace. The most optimistic approach is that AI will make things easier for us. Just like the industrial era or access to computers. And the side effects, well.

People notice it. Google promotes commercialized websites. Bing was also like that - but less commercial, more &#039;gentle&#039;. It becomes like an overlay. Sadly, Google was quite powerful. You could use more advanced research like <i>g something +something -something</i>, or<i> g &quot;this and that&quot;. </i>It starts bringing a &#039;give us the old Google&#039; vibe. I think it was already there when they changed image search.<br />I think people can get used to using GPT or Grok as their search machine. There was already some fuss over it, like it shows people the results of many sites that can&#039;t earn from commercials anymore.<br />Google isn&#039;t yet drowning, but I think they would make it an app.<br /><br />The possibilities I see are that, for example, Google will promote commerce, but people are annoyed by it. They are annoyed by the eavesdropping that is easy to notice (someone mentions something, and it is displayed to you, although you have never searched for it). They will fail at this, so they will either fall or go in the direction of Bing - almost imperceptible political correctness. Their main advantage, however, was access to information. Whether it will still be needed depends on whether people do not unlearn to search for facts on their own - and I am not even talking about how deep they go, but whether they even try - without interpretation served on a plate.<br />What if Meta creates its own search engine? And it comes down not only to ads, but also to the state of mind of people you have among your friends. What they recommend, click, read, is promoted at the top. We have already had a certain test called a pandemic. It turned out that the majority of society cannot think differently than the crowd (although there are exceptions who do not admit it). Virtually everyone is subject to this (including social stratification, the position of opinion leader, or insignificant person), so it&#039;s an interesting phase of the land of Oz created earlier by TV... or, if to not view it such drastically, just a phase of social development. It&#039;s not about &quot;enlightening&quot; everyone with your knowledge. People use things they need. They don&#039;t always care about the deep truth. Sometimes it&#039;s about sympathy through similarity, easier adaptation. From that point of view, it might be OK. From ours, we might need a better device.<br /><br />Recently, I asked Grok to &quot;dissect&quot; or criticize Elon Musk. Funnily, it was made to have less political correctness and have sharp language. So it did criticize him quite ruthlessly and very well.<br />Maybe we should just treat it like a radio show - a journalism, a more or less true or interesting perspective. Simply, one of the possible sources, if you prefer.","attachments":[],"reactions":[]},{"user_id":10359,"user":"Professor Chaos","id":1235597,"date":"2025-03-03T17:19:30+0100","text":"<blockquote data-attributes=\"member: 13103\" data-quote=\"Evan\" data-source=\"post: 1235583\"class=\"bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote js-expandWatch\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-title\"><a href=\"/forum/goto/post?id=1235583\"class=\"bbCodeBlock-sourceJump\"rel=\"nofollow\"data-xf-click=\"attribution\"data-content-selector=\"#post-1235583\">Evan said:</a></div><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-content\"><div class=\"bbCodeBlock-expandContent js-expandContent \"><a href=\"https://cassiopaea.org/forum/members/10359/\" class=\"username\" data-xf-init=\"member-tooltip\" data-user-id=\"10359\" data-username=\"@Professor Chaos\">@Professor Chaos</a> It really bugs me that Google now uses AI as its default engine.
